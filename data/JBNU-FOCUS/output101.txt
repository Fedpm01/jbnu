More than 300 students and family members participated in the event, and were joined by Vice-President Hyo-Geun Shin and Dean of Students Haeng-Geun Ahn.Every year since 2003, this ceremony has introduced Korean Chuseok traditions to the international members of our university and has helped build a sense of fellowship and community.The festivities opened with a Magic show and included a traditional folk game as well as a short quiz-based game about Chuseok. International students also had the opportunity to display their dancing and singing abilities during the talent show.Thibault Davasse (exchange student from Marne le Valle University in France), who participated in the festivities, said that students “did not have a lot of opportunities to learn about Chuseok and its traditions, but we were able to learn a lot about its meaning today and enjoy the company of my international friends through the Chuseok festival.” He also revealed, “Today’s festival has sparked my interest in traditional Korean culture and I look forward to discovering more about these traditions.”On this day, Vice-President Hyo-Geun Shin said, “I know some of our international friends can feel left out during Chuseok and other Korean holidays, so holding this festival is a small gesture to make our international students feel at home in Korea. We hope you enjoy the warm holidays.  00전북대_외국인가족_추석_행사_2.jpgCount : 30401305 K
