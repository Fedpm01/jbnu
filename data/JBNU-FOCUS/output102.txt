Aside from student exchange programs, we would also like to pool each of our academic strengths to allow for growth through cooperation.” In reply, President Geo-Suk Suh said, “The exchange program with University of Canberra will play a big role in helping our students attain global minds and foster their sense of international awareness. I look forward to a successful GLP program with University of Canberra and hope to continue the active cooperation between both universities.”  University of Canberra is a public university founded in 1968, and has a student population of 12,000, nearly 2,500 international students from 100 different countries, and approximately 900 faculty members. University of Canberra is home to Australia’s National Institute of Sports Studies, Institute for Applied Ecology and 24 other research centers. The university has especially proven to be globally competitive in the fields of Information Science, Information Engineering and Information Technology.   00호주_캔버라대학_글래스니_런던_학장(왼쪽_2번째)이_방문,_협약_후_기념촬영.jpgCount : 37336533 K
