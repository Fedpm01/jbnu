The jam targets consumers who are interested in well-being products as well as a younger demographic that purchases bread regularly.  Mulberries, according to the traditional Korean medicine book, Donguibogam, are good for diabetes, beneficial to five different organs, and effective in anti-aging. It also helps prevent strokes, ease hunger and, if consumed regularly, mulberries are said to improve eyesight and hearing. The new product is currently on sale in Lotte Department Store, and, to maintain the premium-level image, will be marketed in the near future at organic foods stores, department stores, and major supermarkets. There will be a tasting and sales promotion event at the Jamsil Lotte Department store from the 23rd to 29th of September.   00백화점에_진열돼_있는_웰빙오디잼.jpgCount : 33187619 K
