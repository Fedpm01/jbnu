It was then followed by an inaugural celebration marked by the signboard hanging ceremony. On this day, it was revealed that the official appellation of the joint research would be called the Los Alamos-Chonbuk National University Korea Engineering Research Center(LANL-CBNU Korea Research Center). There are construction plans underway on the partially completed lab, which will end up being two-story, 1700meter-squared research center behind the Central Library by 2013.    Approximately 11 billion won over a span of 6 years will be invested into this new research facility. The facility will specialize in developing and assessing structural stability and reliability of aircraft wings, wind turbine blades, as well as other forms of quality control technology. The facilities will also include tele-conference rooms that will allow long-distance conferencing throughout the entire year. CBNU aims to boost its research profile in the areas of structural stability and quality control research fields with the opening of this laboratory. This collaborative effort will also benefit our students; CBNU Master’s students and Doctorate students will be able to stay 6 months and 1 year, respectively, at the LANL in the United States, as part of a joint research program, helping our students attain a global mind and become worldly leaders . As an extension of this partnership, CBNU students will also be able to apply for a dual degree program with one of LANL’s closest academic partners, University of California – San Diego (UCSD). Students who participate in the dual degree program will be able to expand their horizons while taking classes at both our school and UCSD, which is ranked 32nd in the World University Rankings(and Top 10 in undergraduate engineering programs). The inauguration of the LANL-CBNU Korea Research Center may become the catalyst that makes Jeollabuk-Do a global epicenter for carbon industry research.  The first project that this research center will embark on will concern the development of technology in structural stability management with composite materials, which is a specialized field of research in Jeollabuk-Do. There is much anticipation on how the progress and developments of the research will affect related fields and world markets as it comes into maturation.  There will also be an advanced level of research in many other fields such as renewable energy, new construction materials and biotechnology, fueling the potential for our university to grow to become a central hub for LANL’s body of research.  On this day, President Geo-Suk Suh said, “Our University boasts a research reputation worthy of our ranking in the Times Higher Education, where we placed 8th among Korean Universities and 3rd among national universities in Korea. I have no doubt that the opening of this joint research center will boost our research reputation beyond regional and national borders and even help the entire nation improve its research competitiveness.”  LANL, established in 1943, has a budget of 2.6 trillion won and employs nearly 10,000 people. This U.S. government institute covers various research fields such as nuclear energy, composite material, biotechnology, renewable energy and aeronautical engineering. LANL had more than 1,500 ISI research papers published and lives true to the reputation of one of the world’s best research centers. 양식의 맨  00전북대-로스알라모스_공동연구소_개소_1.jpgCount : 36326766 K
