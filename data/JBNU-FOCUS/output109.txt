This is attributable to a combination of tireless efforts to increase research competitiveness by our university staff, the equally diligent dedication of professors, and the thorough communication between members of our university.  Since President Geo-Suk Suh’s appointment in 2006, our university implemented a strategic plan to increase university competitiveness through research competitiveness. Our school’s research programs have received full-fledged support ever since.   Our university expanded its research support system through the years. Requirement for job advancement have become twice as much meticulous, but professors now receive 100 million won if any of their research papers are published in one of the “Big Three” academic Journals (Science, Nature, Cells). Professors conducting research are also given some relief from teaching classes and assigned with student research assistants to provide help in their research.  Starting in 2007, our university has also been active in promoting research activity and providing a research environment that is suitable even for outside institutions and corporations President Suh said, “We faced some challenges in the beginning, but with our staff’s positive attitude and our professors’ ardent efforts we have been able to enjoy great accolades from our research programs. We will continue to work harder so that the term ‘research competitiveness’ becomes synonymous with CBNU.” 00학교_전경.jpgCount : 36496895 K
