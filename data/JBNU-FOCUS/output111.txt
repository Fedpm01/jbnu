Fully funded by the Korean government, this Korea-Sri Lanka Friendship Hospital was founded to provide natural disaster relief in the impoverished areas of Matara. Additional Secretary of the Sri Lanka Ministry of Health, Dr. Paltha Mahipala, paid a visit to Prof. Joo and the rest of the volunteer team to personally thank them and asked for their continued support, especially with the impending inauguration of the Korea-Sri Lanka Friendship hospital.  Our volunteer team’s efforts and the upcoming plans to open the Korea-Sri Lanka Friendship Hospital was televised nationally in Sri Lanka, giving locals a chance to appreciate Korea’s philanthropic endeavors.  Prof Joo said, “We came back from tsunami-struck regions in Sri Lanka and helped the local medical professionals install and familiarize themselves with some of the latest medical equipment the Korean government has generously donated. Next January we plan on going to the mountain regions of Sri Lanka to, once again, help impoverished communities that need our aid.“ Since 1997, the CBNU Medical School Overseas Volunteer Team has gone to Bangladesh, Nepal, Russia and many other countries. In April 2011, the team was nationally recognized as proud recipients of the Boryeong Medical Volunteer Award. 00전북대_의료봉사단_스리랑카신문_게재_사진.jpgCount : 35848196 K
