The purpose of the committee is to carry out the objectives of the ACE project and improve the undergraduate education system.  On this day, President Geo-Suk Suh, Chair of the Promotions Committee and Dean of Academic Affairs Young Jeong Kim, and the rest of the committee members promised to formulate and implement a distinctly progressive educational model for undergraduate students. Our university received nearly 12 billion won in funding from the Ministry of Education and will embark on the ACE project for four years until the year 2015. With Dean of Academic Affairs Young Jeong Kim as the Committee Chair, the committee is composed of 40 members and 14 sub-committees that fall under the umbrella of three main Task Force teams: The Educational System Development Team, Curriculum Development Team, and Ranking and Evaluation System Development Team. Our university aims to refine an educational model that strengthens academic concentration through a firm foundation in core curriculums through the ACE Project and will begin its implementation with next year’s newly admitted students. Recently, students have shown a lack of familiarity with key subject matters and this new educational model will instill a solid foundation in basic study areas to provide a seamless transition into academic majors and concentrations.  In order to strengthen core curriculums and academic concentrations, our university will be the first national university in Korea to adopt a “four semester system,” where students with poor grades will have to attend four extended course modules (winter, spring, summer and fall) in one academic year. The “2+2 semester system,” in which a four-year course load is divided into two years of core curriculums and two years of academic concentration studies, will also fortify the education system at CBNU.  Another goal is to establish clear pre-requisite course structures and increase the number of classes divided according to skill level from 3 to 10 classes, as well as expand on the development of class material and media contents.  There are plans to reorganize the current curriculum and create a Major Intensity Track(department qualifications, interdisciplinary majors) to strengthen academic concentration studies.  CBNU especially believes in maintaining and improving upon the quality of education and expects the Ranking and Evaluation System Team to play a particularly big role in this matter.  The Ranking and Evaluation System Team plans to develop teaching and course feedback systems, basic education and core competence certification evaluation tools, student management programs for students on academic probation, and education satisfaction assessment systems. In addition, our university will expand on a variety of extracurricular programs like local community outreach and social service programs, as well as career guidance activities.  Courses like career management and career development camp will be mandatory courses and the same principles of strengthening core curriculums will be applied to the increasing number of international students at our university. On this day President Suh remarked, “Today we commemorate the foundation of the ACE Project Promotions Committee and take the first step to being recognized as the best and most competitive university in Korea. From this day forward we will have the most advanced and progressive education program in the nation.”  00ACE사업_추진단_개소식_기념촬영.jpgCount : 37413120 K
