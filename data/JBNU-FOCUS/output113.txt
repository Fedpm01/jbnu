제목Global Trade Expert Program Becomes Bridge to Exporting for Local Businesses                    국제교류부  | 2011-11-15 | 조회 3570본문 내용 Our university’s Global Trade Expert Program(GTEP), a special student development program run by Prof. Chung Won Yoon, is playing a big role in widening the clientele spectrum of small businesses in the Jeonju area. Recently our university’s GTEP connected UmiTech, a small business located in Palbok-dong in Jeonju, with a United States buyer and has finalized a sales contract that details an yearly $500,000 U.S. dollar purchase of cosmetic products.  CBNU student and GTEP member Soo Jung Lim(Junior majoring in International Trade) took the initiative to establish various points of contact with the overseas client and eventually lead to a substantial transaction, proving the program’s value in providing hands-on experience to our students.  In addition, members travelled abroad to attend an international conference, where they were able to procure prospective buyers for businesses in Jeonju. The trip turned out to be a great success, as they were able to secure a $300,000 export deal with a foreign client.  Members of the program have proven to be valuable translators and interpreters for local businesses and through part-time internships, have provided considerable support to the daily commercial operations of small local firms. Projector Director Prof. Yoon said, “With UmiTech’s recently arranged export contract, which outlines the purchase of 500,000 dollars worth of cosmetic products, our program members successfully played the liaison that connects local small businesses with foreign clients. We would like to thank the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, the Korean Foreign Trade Association, the CBNU Industry-Academy Cooperation Foundation, the Jeollabuk-do province and Jeonju city for their ongoing support despite challenging times.”  Prof. Yoon added, “We will continue to actively support the exporting endeavors of local small businesses.”  The GTEP is a national program that trains students in foreign languages and in the fields of commerce and trade so that they can become expert professionals while also supporting local small businesses and their export marketing needs.   00전북대학교_GTEP사업단_임수정양이_중국_광저우_캔톤_전시회에서_상담하는_모습.jpgCount : 32167024 K
