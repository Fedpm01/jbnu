Representatives from both universities presented diverse ideas and topics discussing ways to intensify cooperation. The day started with a 09:30 AM ceremony that looked back on the 20 years of academic exchange between the two universities. The president of each university presented commemorative tablets to one another, and promised to open the doors for further exchange and collaboration. The following symposium featured TU Vice-President Yukihisa Kitamura’s presentation on “Tohoku University’s Incorporation Process” and CBNU Dean of College of Engineering Dong-Won Kim’s “Chonbuk National University Innovations in Engineering Education” presentation. The afternoon included presentations discussing “Tohoku University’s State of International Exchange and challenges going forward” and CBNU Dean of Academic Affairs Young Jung Kim explained our university’s goals towards developing a progressive undergraduate educational model as part of the ACE program (Advanced College of Education). University representatives also had the opportunity to visit Jeonju Hanok Village, and shared amicable words over dinner. TU President Inoue Akihisa said, “Out of the 200 universities in Korea, we signed an agreement with Chonbuk National University first and this university also graciously gave us the most help after the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in March.” He added, “I hope that we can strengthen our relationship through this 20-year anniversary ceremony.”  President Suh Said, “Korea’s representative university, Chonbuk National University, and Japan’s representative university, Tohoku University, and the 20-year history of exchange between both universities has made me reminiscent. I am certain that the close collaboration between our universities will play a key role in the development of our countries, and I hope the academic exchange between the two universities will carry on through 50 years, 100 years.” TU was established third among Japanese national universities in 1907.
