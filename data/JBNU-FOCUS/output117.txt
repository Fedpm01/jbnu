제목CBNU at the Center of Hanok Construction Education                    국제교류부  | 2011-12-13 | 조회 3928본문 내용 The Hanok enterprise, which is part of a broader “Han Style” enterprise, is currently facing financial burdens and a slow rate of progress despite continuous support from the city of Jeonju. One of the impediments to progress is the lack of trained professionals in Hanok design and construction. Jeonju is heavily involved in the cultural preservation of Hanok, especially because of its upkeep of the Hanok Village. However, recent substandard re-construction efforts have made it clear that there is a dire need for professional training and education in Hanok design and theory.  Since last year our university has responded by offering various programs related to Hanok and its study. Befitting to the title of “the most Korean global university,” CBNU has established a Hanok project promotions team and even founded a Hanok Studies department focused around the theory and practice of Hanok construction.  This year, CBNU established the Hanok Construction Technology Center and was selected by the Ministry of Land Transport and Maritime Affairs to begin training in Hanok design as part of the “Specialized Professional Development Program in Hanok Design.” Our university accomplished the splendid feat of being the only university selected for this task in the Jeolla-do region.  Currently, construction professionals who have surpassed a considerable admittance rate of 5 to 1 are receiving high-quality, specialized training in Hanok design and even hands-on education in Hanok construction from the likes of living cultural treasure, Gi Young Choi.  CBNU, also considered to have “the most Korean campus,” will aim to spur excitement by hosting a design competition for students with the mission of re-designing the CBNU main building in Hanok style. Starting next year, the Graduate School of Environmental Studies will inaugurate a Hanok Studies department, the first of its kind in the nation, to educate people in the art of Hanok. The department will offer a two-year curriculum in Hanok theory and practical training, and is currently open for admissions.  The development of Hanok professionals will also take place at our Gochang campus(formerly of Korea Polytechnic University), which was acquired from the Gochang district. Our university’s programs for development of Hanok professionals are expected to boost the “Han style” enterprise and have a positive impact in the Hallyu enterprise in the Jeollabuk-do region. Many are also hoping CBNU’s support of localized programs will ultimately promote local economic growth. Hye-Kyung Nam, Head of Campus Development Headquarters, said “Just like how our campus is always striving to be the most Korean campus, investing in Hanok related development programs is an inspiration to the region and our country. I hope the program will foster talented professionals that can maintain Jeollabuk-do’s reputation as the birthplace of Hanok. Moreover, I hope it will encourage other organizations and government institutions to support the cultural preservation of Hanok.  00한옥건출기술_종합센터_개소_1_1.jpgCount : 38350038 K
