As one of the nation’s landmark universities, AUB was recognized in Spain as a Campus of International Excellence. Spurred by the success of the Erasmus program, which established an international network for academic exchange, the Ortelius program facilitates collaborative programs between Spain, Asia and Latin America. The objective is to increase international mobility among students, teaching and research staff, and administration and services staff. Students from universities that participate in the program can take advantage of the joint degrees and double degrees the program offers.  The trip to Barcelona was followed by a visit to the Czech Technical University in Prague. President Suh signed agreements on the invitation of distinguished graduate school students and student exchange programs that will begin in the 2012 school year. President Suh also took the opportunity to garner support for the “CBNU International Summer School” at all the universities visited during this trip. The participation of renowned professors and exceptional students is expected to increase the global makeup of our university. President Suh said, “The recent trip to Europe allowed us to open the door to international cooperation with European universities by establishing exchange agreements for students and faculty members. The double degree programs we have established offer a unique and pragmatic platform for academic exchange and brings our university closer to living up to the name of a ‘global campus.’” 00바르셀로나자치대학교(아나_리폴_아라실_총장_일행과).jpgCount : 39347591 K
