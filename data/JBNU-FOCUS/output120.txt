While Catalan and Spanish(more specifically, Castilian) are used interchangeably in the Catalonia region, most of the names of locations and businesses are in Catalan, making the understanding of this language all the more important for travelers and visitors. In December of last year, Prof. Choi visited the Catalonia Parliament and presented the dictionary to Chairman Núria de Gispert with faculty members of the Autonomous University of Barcelona and students from the Korean Language Studies Department at the Barcelona Language School. This dictionary is the accumulation of five years’ worth of lexicographic compilation with the support of the CBNU International Joint Research Fund, the National Research Foundation of Korea and the Catalonian Government. The dictionary was compiled to increase the level of exchange with the Catalonia region, an area that plays a crucial in Korea-Spain relations. Ultimately, this it is expected to increase the amount of academic exchange between Korea and Spain. Prof. Choi said, “Korea is still not a very well-known country in Spain, but I think the compilation and presentation of this dictionary will spark the interest of the people in Catalonia, which is the epicenter of commerce in Spain. The Catalan people possess an exceptional amount of pride and attachment to the Catalan language, and I think they will be pleased to know that this dictionary is being published in Korea.” He continued, “Recently the spread of K-POP and Korean culture has instigated a boom in the interest to learn the Korean language in Spain, and I have no doubt this dictionary will be very useful. Moreover, I hope this dictionary will help increase the awareness of Korean culture throughout Spain.”  00전북대_최낙원_교수(맨_오른쪽)가_카탈루냐_주_의회에_사전을_증정하고_있다.jpgCount : 46299323 K
