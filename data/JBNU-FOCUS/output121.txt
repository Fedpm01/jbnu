Although you may be away from your home, I hope you enjoy and welcome the Lunar New Year with the family you have forged here at CBNU.”  This ceremony has been held every year since 2003 for international students who have to spend the Lunar New Year away from their family back home. It has been hugely popular and successful because members of our international community get to learn new aspects about Korean culture and it also promotes friendship with our international students and faculty members.  00전북대_외국인_가족을_위한_설날_큰잔치.jpgCount : 41287283 K
