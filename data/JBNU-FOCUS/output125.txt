제목CNBU, Sole University in Honam Region Selected as Industry-University Cooperation University                    국제교류부  | 2012-04-23 | 조회 3294본문 내용 Chonbuk National University was the only university in the Honam region to be selected to the Industry-University Cooperation Project (as part of the 2012 Industry-University-Institute Collaborative Research Program) by the Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA). The SMBA based their selection on CBNU’s thorough support for previous industry-university cooperation projects, as well as regular research and development (R&D) projects. For this reason, they decided to fund only CBNU in the province. The Industrial-University Cooperation Project, which is a new project for the SMBA, carefully selected five universities throughout the nation from each province, allowing university infrastructure to be readily available to local small businesses while providing up to one billion won in funding to each university.  Our university has planned to help small and medium businesses by offering R&D programs for green industries and non-R&D programs for businesses looking to commercialize technologies (i.e. business consulting, consultant services, patenting, technology commercialization, design, marketing, market development). In addition, being recently named one of the Leaders in Industry-university Cooperation(LINC) and awarded 2.5 billion in research funds by the Ministry of Education has made CBNU the most prominent university in the industry-university cooperation domain. President Geo-Suk Suh said, “It is very pleasing to be selected as a leading university for in industry-university cooperative projects among other universities. CBNU will do its best to contribute to the development of the small businesses by implementing a systematic support system.    00산학협력_이미지.jpgCount : 47362038 K
