This amount reaches nearly 22.7 million dollars with the inclusion of financial support from local government bodies and internally incentivized funds. CBNU’s success in procuring funds is attributable to its revamped support system for industry-university cooperation and commendable efforts to develop a leading cooperation model.Additionally, our university received praise from various organizations for building a one-stop support center for collaboration projects with industrial corporations, and establishing plans to operate a family company. The LINC program especially lauded the performance and the development of industry professionals and research personnel of our ongoing programs such as the Education Center for Renewable Energy Industry and the Healthcare Technology Development Center. CBNU will continue to develop skilled professionals in the renewable energy industry sector, which is one of the main focuses of the university’s industry-university cooperation efforts. 00산학협력.jpgCount : 37329305 K
