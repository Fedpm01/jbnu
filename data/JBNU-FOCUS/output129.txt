It is clear that CBNU is one of the leading universities in technology licensing. As a result, CBNU received nearly 200 million won in financial support aimed at facilitating the discovery and commercialization of advanced technologies. Due to the rewarding endeavors of the program, CBNU plans to adopt policies that inject more resources into prototyping and technology licensing.  Our university recorded approximately 1 billion won in revenues last year generated from patents and proprietary technologies. In addition, the CBNU TLO program received praise for incrementing the revenue per patent by 158% in a 3-year span since 2008.  University-industry cooperation Director Nam-Pyo Cho said, “The reason why our university received high marks from the TLO Support Program was because of the effort we put in and results we generated. We aim to promote and market emerging technologies and expect that the profit accrued from our endeavors will have a big impact on the university.“ 00연구_및_실험_이미지.jpgCount : 42294397 K
