In addition, CBNU has made exchange agreements with some of the most prestigious universities located in the United States and Europe to host and send students abroad. Expand the number of international students over 1,000 students are working towards a degree here at CBNU. Our international students have also proven to be the most distinguished students after focusing efforts on admitting the most capable students. An impressive 23.3 percent of our students have obtained Level 4 or higher in the national Korean language proficiency exam, TOPIK. This percentage ranks in the top 10 percentile among regional core universities.   To boost our international profile even more, CBNU inaugurated the International Summer School program during the summer break, offering students from around the world a wide variety of courses and the opportunity to experience Korean culture in the city of Jeonju.  President Geo-Suk Suh said, “Despite the numerous restrictions given to national universities relative to private universities, our efforts in expanding our international orientation have finally shown merit today. We will continue to recruit international professors and students, and cooperate with universities from abroad to maintain our reputation as the most Korean, globally prestigious university.   00국제화_지수_높은_우리대학.jpgCount : 46358859 K
