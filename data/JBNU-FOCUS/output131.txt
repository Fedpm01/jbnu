제목Inaugural International Summer School Begins                    국제교류부  | 2012-07-25 | 조회 5634본문 내용 As Chonbuk National University settles down during summer break, students from around the world are gathering at our globalized campus.  Our university launched its inaugural session of International Summer School (ISS) with the opening ceremony on July 2nd, 03:00 PM, at the 2nd floor auditorium of the CBNU museum building.  The event was commemorated with a Korean dance and music performance, and followed by President Geo-Suk Suh giving a brief introduction of the courses, professors and students from each country.  More than 50 students from our sister universities in the United States, France, Spain, Japan and other countries have come to our university to receive language instruction in Korean and English, enroll in multi-disciplinary courses, interact with students from all over the world, and experience traditional Korean culture. Meanwhile, our university has also brought in some of the most distinguished students from the United States through the Critical Language Scholarship(CLS) Program, which is run by the United States Department of State. Since June 18th, these students have been receiving intensive Korean language training classes for this 8-week program,  ISS is a program that brings together local and international students from around the world during summer break with the purpose of cultivating global minds and introducing Korean culture while obtaining transferrable credits for courses.  Born as an offshoot of “Feeling Korea,” a Korean culture immersion program that was held during the summer and winter breaks, ISS differs from its predecessor in that it offers legitimate academic courses for international students rather than just a mere experiential program.  The ultimate goal and expected outcome of the program is to exert a positive influence on Chonbuk National University and the nation’s most Korean city, Jeonju.   Additionally, the program benefits our local students as they get to hone their proficiency in English, interact with a diverse group of intellectual students and cultivate their global mindset at the same time. President Suh said, “The International Summer School program allows local and international students to take a variety of courses together. This is truly the make-up of a global campus. We will continue to expand the courses offered and invite renowned professors from abroad to create one of Korea’s most exciting and successful summer programs.”  00국제하계대학입학식5.jpgCount : 40394743 K
