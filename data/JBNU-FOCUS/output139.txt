This has been troubled the team with their reliability. Professor Hong’s team, however, put a thin GaN layer containing graphene on a sapphire board by using ‘Graphene Patterning Process’, and succeeded in manufacturing a LED element.   A graphene has higher heat conductivity than a copper at more than ten times. Thus it could lower temperature of a semiconductor significantly by releasing and distributing heat evenly.   This technology allows a high current drive system and, therefore a high-powered LED can be realized in a horizontal LED, which generates large amount of heat.    Graphene Patterning Process, developed solely by Professor Hong’s team, can be immediately mass-produced because it is not limited to any size or form.  It also allows an easy-production via a high heat treatment, and thus it is expected to be commercialized soon. This technology is already patented in Korea, and is being processed to be internationally patented in countries like America.  Professor Hong says, “This research has a significance for its use of Graphene for the world’s first. I will do my best to commercialize this technology soon.” For your information, the world’s first division of Graphene gave Prof. Andre Geim and Doctor Konstantin Novoselov of University of Manchester, UK the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010. Graphene has received wide attention from the world’s academia for its trait, such as 0.7 nanometer thickness,  100X stronger than a steel, 100X higher electric conductivity than a copper, and 100X faster electron transporting speed than semiconductor silicone.   00홍창희교수님.jpgCount : 41209356 K
