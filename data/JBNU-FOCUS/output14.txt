　Chonbuk National University recently drew up a plan to set up a dormitory that can accommodate up to 2,500 students by attracting private capital of 40.9 billion won. This is part of the BTL (Build-Transfer-Lease) project carried out by the government. The BTL (민간자본유치사업) is a new type of private investment system by which the government leases buildings constructed by private businesses. The government has arranged the BTL scheme with the intention of providing public facilities such as schools or rental apartments.

　The government announced that they will choose private investors who will participate in the BTL project; a select group will then begin construction in the latter half of the year. Accordingly, Chonbuk University is in the middle of examining the eligibility of the budget for construction and operation of a new dormitory. As soon as the analysis is finished, the university will recruit private investors.

　If the new housing is completed in 2007 according to the schedule, it will be the biggest dormitory among 27 domestic national universities.
