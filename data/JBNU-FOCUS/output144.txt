Their purpose was to provide their medical services to the local community. The team of volunteers consisted of 13 people, including Professor Shin Hyo-Geun and Baek Jin-A (Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Graduate School of Dentistry). Each day the team carried out 8-10 maxillofacial surgeries per day and in total they carried out 38 surgeries.  Their presence attracted a large number of patients, however due to the lack of time; the team could not treat all patients. They only treated the most serious cases and performed a full range of surgical procedures, such as cleft lip and palate surgery and maxillofacial reconstruction.  The leader of the team, Professor Shin Hyo-Geun expressed his opinions about the trip, “All 13 volunteer members put their efforts to provide excellent medical care in order to give the local people a gift of life”. He also described that, “by continuing to volunteer I hope to deliver them a warm love from Korea”. Since signing the MoU in 2006, this is the eighth time that the Graduate School of Dentistry has volunteered in Hue Univesity.﻿ 00전북대_치전원_해외봉사팀_베트남_의료봉사.jpgCount : 3991033 K
