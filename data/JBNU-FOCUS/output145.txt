제목Professor Lee Dong Won created an Anticancer Prodrug out of a cinnamon                    국제교류부  | 2013-11-13 | 조회 3845본문 내용  Professor Lee Dong Won is receiving academic attention for his discovery of Cinnamaldehyde, an anticancer prodrug.   Prodrug: a biologically inactive compound which can be metabolized in the body to produce a drug. His paper was published by the Advanced Functional Materials on October 25th.   Cinnamon’s Cinnamaldehyde, known for its anticancer effect, has low counter and high medical effect. It, however, caused some difficulties during testing, because it decomposes rapidly in a human body and is ejected.  Professor Lee turned Cinnamaldehyde into a high molecule nanomaterial and succeeded creating an anticancer prodrug. It can also be used as a transmitting substance for existing anticancer remedies. It is also proven that the synergy effect becomes greater when existing remedies are used together with the prodrug professor Lee created.   If combined with image technology, it would be applied to the early diagnosing method of cancer and also to the creation of intelligent nanoparticles, which can both diagnose and cure cancer at the same time.   This research will soon go on to the human trial and be released for people to use.  Professor Lee expects his Cinnamaldehyde can be applied to both diagnosis & cure of a cancer. He is confident that his creation can also help to remove cancer’s counter effect as well.  This research was funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology WCU BIN Fusion Technology Business, and it will be partnered with Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology.    00이동원_교수(BIN융합공학과).jpgCount : 645423574 K
