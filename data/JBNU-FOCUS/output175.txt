In different spots the team uncovered two dwelling sites at the Proto-Three Kingdoms period(BC 100~AD 300). “Discovering corridor-type building remains is the most noteworthy result this time,” said Jong-Cheol Lee, a curator for CBNU Museum. The L-shape building relic is identified to have 30 meter long major axis, 14 meter long minor axis and 4 to 4.4 meter long center-to-center distance, equipping with pieces of square-shaped jeokshim, a pile of small rocks fixed on the mud floor right under each foundation stone that supports a pillar mostly seen in large Korean traditional buildings. The team also confirmed that through soil inspection, they found that there should have been large-scale groundworks for the building. Only the south half was discovered as of now, but there is a possibility to find a large building site with U-shaped corridor, or 8 rooms widthwise and 4 rooms depthwise, if the museum goes on with a full-scale investigation. Regarding overlapping relations, the building site is older than other relics, and roof tiles engraved with lines and grids were found. The team says this concludes that the building is a ruin from Later Baekje period. In addition, fragments of giwa, a roof tile used in traditional korean houses, along with broken pieces of celadons(korean pottery glazed in jade green color) and grayish-blue-powdered celadons as well as soft and hard earthenware. Celadons around 12th century forms majority of the antiquities and some celadon parts assumed to be chinese porcelains were found. With this in view, Bonglim Temple Site is considered to be kept alive for the two periods in the korean history – Later Three Kingdoms and Joseon - despite the fact that it is not written in documents. “This excavation following last year’s makes it clearer that Bonglim Temple Site of Wanju is from Later Baekje area,” said Dong-Ho Ko, Director of CBNU Museum. “Through further studies, we are going to thoroughly examine composition of building sites and correlations, as well as dating excavated relics and preparing ground for annual research to measure the arrangement of Bonglim Temple Site, so that it could be loved by people as one of the precious cultural and tourism resources in Korea.” 00160708_Another Architecture Remains of Later Three Kingdoms.jpgCount : 39108546 K
