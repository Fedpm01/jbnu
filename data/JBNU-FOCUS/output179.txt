This research outcome was published in the UK-based journal eminent in the energy field, Nano Energy (Volume 28, Impact Factor 11.553), issued this fall.  The biggest challenge of solar cells is that they cost high and ‘die’ fast. But compared to silicon-based solar cells, perovskite solar cell is known to be mass-produced at relatively lower cost and to have higher generation efficiency, making it studied worldwide.  Unfortunately, despite its advantages, perovskite solar cell has had problems in durability and photocurrent density as low as 74% of theoretical value when contacting the air, due to decomposition of perovskite and hole-transport high molecular substance. Researchers all over the world have exerted themselves to solve this matter to commercialize the solar cell in a wide range.  Hahn’s team developed a hybrid nanocomposite material by synthesizing nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles and perovskite to solve this problem, developing and applying a nanocomposites on active layers. The photocurrent density rose up to 97% of theoretical value and generating efficiency increased to twice as much as it originally was.  Also, the newly developed Ag-rGO composite solution showed remarkable air stability under ambient environment, with longer stability over 60 days retaining up to 90% of its original amount.  “We focused on ameliorating the shortcomings of perovskite and organic solar cell to eliminate obstacles to commercialization,” said Hahn, the 2016 Rudolph A. Marcus Award winner. “It is meaningful because my team’s research opened up a possibility of inexpensive solar cells of improved quality.”  The research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and BK 21 Plus Project, with the participation of Tahmineh Mahmoudi, Seunghui Seo, Hwa-Young Yang, Won-Yeop Rho, Yousheng Wang and Yoon-Bong Hahn. 00Longer-life Solar Cell of Enhanced Quality.jpgCount : 4055193 K
