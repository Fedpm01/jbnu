제목CBNU Sweeps Research Support Projects                    홍보실  | 2016-12-20 | 조회 3135본문 내용 Chonbuk National University’s researchers including full-time professors won 61 government and private research support projects solely in November 2016, according to CBNU’s Bureau of University-Industry Cooperation & Research.  With this, the University secured research fund of 11.2 billion won (KRW). One of the research teams is Professor Jae-ik Han’s (Dept. of Veterinary Medicine), studying ways to quickly diagnose zoonoses (infectious diseases of animals that can naturally be transmitted to humans — wikipedia) caused by wildlife.  Han’s team was chosen for ‘Environmental Policy Based Public Technology Development Project’ supported by the Korean Ministry of Environment, and therefore receives 3 billion won in three years.  Other researchers were also awarded national projects and civil services supporting basic researchers, young researchers and scientists in local universities, giving wider publicity to the University’s research competitiveness.  The list of selected research projects is as follows:* Development of the Disease Control System via Investigation of Abortion in
