Accordingly, our university will send about 10 exchange students there early next year. The International Affairs Office(IAO) will accept applications from October 4th until th 11th. The requirement for application are GPA over 4.0 and TOEFL PBT scores over 525. The required documents are an application form, a study plan in English, a resume in English, a school report card, and a TOEFL record sheet. The documents should be sent to IAO after downloading and filling it out the required forms from the IAO webpage. The students who are selected after passing a written examination and an interview will pay just 50% of our university's tuition fee because our university will support 80% of the expense for them, and our university will recognizes the credits that they complete at NDSU.
