Therefore, detailed support for the international students is essential," said CBNU President Lee Namho. "We will try to communicate more to help them adjust to university life and have positive feelings about studying in Korea."  00170307_CBNU Holds New Years Day Event for International Students.jpgCount : 430 KB170307_CBNU Holds New Year's Day Event for International Students.jpgCount : 472727931 K
