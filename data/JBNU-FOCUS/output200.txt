In this semester, 17 graduate students including 11 from Uganda will take a university-industry co-operative master's course interacting with local companies and farmers.Currently, most of the foreign agro-livestock workers in Korea lack expertise in the field.By nurturing students from developing countries, CBNU will eventually contribute to professional labor supply, so that the domestic industry could find a way to expand the export market to developing countries. 0001_CBNU Trains Ugandan Agro-livestock Experts.jpgCount : 731756320 K
