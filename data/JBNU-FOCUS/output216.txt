Through the joint research with Prof. Tae-Lim Choi’s team at Seoul National University (Chemistry Dept.), the team has identified physicochemical properties.   The newly developed actuating polymer material can be applied to a wide range of fields such as robotics, electronic sensors, flexible electrodes and logic circuits, all of which are attracting the world’s attention ahead of the ‘fourth industrial revolution.’   The research was made possible by the support from the Korean Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Science with the participation of Dae-Yoon Kim, Suyong Shin, Won-Jin Yoon, Yu-Jin Choi, Joo-Kyoung Hwang, Jin-Soo Kim, Cheul-Ro Lee, Tae-Lim Choi and Kwang-Un Jeong.   The study was awarded as an ‘excellent paper’ by the Polymer Society of Korea in this spring, proving the superiority and optical efficiency of the new material.   It was published in the May issue of Advanced Functional Materials (IF = 11.382, TOP = 4.244%), one of the top academic journals in materials science. 00170529_CBNU Team Develops New RC Polymer_1.jpgCount : 71781542 K
