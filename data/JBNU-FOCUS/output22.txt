The 2nd meeting for making friends with foreigners, held under the auspices of the Pacific Asia Society, consisted of a Korean Traditional dyeing activity, a folk game, a quiz of tradition, and a Chonbuk University Ham cooking contest. About 80 Geonjians joined in the event and said that they made friends with foreigners easily without being worried about English. Unfortunately, the staff members were inexperienced and the program had many delays which annoyed the participants.

Last year, fourteen departments and clubs participated in the Hanmadang, but this year twenty four teams took part in this festival, which made the Hanmadang more exiting. However, the rate of participation in some programs was, still low because Geonjians joined in some events only for pleasure and some professors did not cancel their lectures. "I'm pleased that the Hanmadang is developing and I hope the Hanmadang will be held on a larger scale by joining with other colleges next year,"said President Oh.
