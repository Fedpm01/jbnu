Ultimately, they will develop a therapeutic agent to control metabolic diseases through regulation of enzyme activity of the identified genes.In addition to developing new medicines for the treatment and prevention of metabolic inflammation, the research team plans to publish world-class papers, to apply patents, and to foster medical scientists to lead the next generation. 00170725_CBNU Prepares for Metabolic Inflammation Research Center_4.jpgCount : 6837868 K
