In addition, they have proven that the isolated hematopoietic stem cells transplanted into the adult mice showed multi-lineage differentiation ability to form various blood cells, and even self-renewal potential. The study was carried out with the support of the National Research Foundation of Korea, with the participation of Hyun-Jung Sim and Professor Jeong-Chae Lee. The team’s further research is underway to clarify the role of P2Y14 protein in hematopoietic stem cells derived from adult mouse bone marrow.  00170926_Cancer Treatment Using Discarded Placenta.jpgCount : 792222871 K
