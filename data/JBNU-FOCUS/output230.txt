The research outcome was patented in the United States, and was published in the latest issue of Springer. Lee previously revealed the mathematical identity of the genetic code of DNA protein that constitutes the human body, and the bars in the Korean national flag, Taegeukki, for the first time in the world. It has long been known that the 24 pairs of human chromosomes are slightly different in the order of the DNA that constitutes them, and that they have a double helix structure. However, the technique of converting double-stranded DNA to single-stranded RNA (ribonucleic acid) or the reverse direction hadn’t been mathematically discovered. To solve this problem, Lee’s team designed the ‘Taegeuk’ (the symbol of yin and yang) pattern genetic code by analyzing the chromosomal DNA as a mathematical matrix based on the combination order sequence of four groups. The result indicates that every person has a copy of the Taegeuk pattern DNA gene, and the patterns of people with (hereditary) diseases are squashed. The research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea, and its results were announced at the AIMEE in Moscow and Bio Smart in Paris recently. It is expected to be widely used for genome editing technology that can be used for the treatment of diseases.  00170926_DNA Genes Designed Into Math Matrix.jpgCount : 56202469 K
