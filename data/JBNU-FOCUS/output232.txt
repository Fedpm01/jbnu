"My team's research is meaningful because it's a step closer to commercialization of higher performance solar cells at low prices." The research was made possible by the support of the Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning with the participation of Yousheng Wang, Tahmineh Mahmoudi, Won-Yeop Rho, Hwa-Young Yang, Seunghui Seo, Kiesar Sideeq Bhat, Rafiq Ahmad, and Yoon-Bong Hahn.  00171023_Cheaper and Better-Performing Perovskite Solar Cell.jpgCount : 7078966 K
