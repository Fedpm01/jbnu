D. student, Mechanical Design Engineering) presented the results of her research that developed a technique to effectively pack fruits through mass production of nanofibers using natural oil with an antibacterial effect at the 2017 Autumn Meeting of the Korean Society For Biomaterials. Through this study, it will be possible to extend the shelf-life period of peaches, strawberries, and mangos and to help prevent fruit diseases such as anthracnose. Earlier this year, the Korean Ministry of Education and the Korea Research Foundation selected Lee for the "Global Doctoral Fellowship" to support world-class researchers. In addition, Tumurbaatar Batgerel (Ph. D. student, Mechanical Design Engineering) won the “Best Paper” award at the 13th International Young Researcher Technology Innovation Society. Batgerel has successfully synthesized drugs and magnetic nanoparticles so that the user can remotely control the position of nanorobots implanted inside the human body and deliver drugs. This is advantageous in that an electromagnetic field can be generated in desired directions, thus inducing the motion of the magnetic nanorobot in designated directions. Also, it is designed to track a nanorobot in real time by developing a user-definable window-based control program and a position tracking vision system. The research was carried out with the support of the Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Korea Research Foundation.  00171110_Mechanical Engineering Students Receive Awards.jpgCount : 61226651 K
