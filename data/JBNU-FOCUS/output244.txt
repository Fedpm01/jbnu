The ministry announced the technology as legislation (2014-20) in 2014.   As a result, the "Portable Blood Viscosity Inspector" (Patent Registration No. 10-1701334) was successfully registered in January 2017. Also, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (formerly Korean Food and Drug Administration) approved the commercialization of the next-generation blood viscosity inspector for clinical use in June 2017 (KFDA-Class 1 A22240.01(1)).   Finally, Lee’s technology has been recognized as an ‘uninsured benefit’ by the national Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service, and was commercialized for use in diagnosis and treatment at medical institutions in Korea, in October 2017.  0
