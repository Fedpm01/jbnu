"We need to build a well-structured system, as the amount of time to accumulate experiences will decidedly make it or break it."   "It is necessary to establish a non-identification information system through a non-identification process of various data so that the data can be used as public property," he added. "Currently, 60% of elementary school students are expected to have jobs that do not exist at the present time. As can be seen from this, a flexible education system should be prepared according to changes in industrial systems."   Roh said, “It is also necessary to establish a legal and ethical response system for the problems we will face when artificial intelligence technologies such as autonomous vehicles become more common in the near future.”   At the forum, the reality and future of industrial application of artificial intelligence technology were also discussed by panelists and the audience. 00180305_Scholars Discuss Preparation for New Industrial Revolution.jpgCount : 1012102633 K
