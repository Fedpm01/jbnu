NIOSH is a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services.   The two organizations will conduct joint international research for the development and commercialization of source technologies related to energy resource development and mine safety until December 2022, through research cooperation, exchanges of researchers, joint use of research equipment, as well as strengthening of an information sharing system.   The Spokane Research Laboratory has been conducting research on mining, safety and environment for coal mining, and metal and non-metal mines.   NIOSH's resource development activities include suggestion of appropriate standards to the US Mine Safety and Health Administration through research based on the federal budget, and involvement in the safety activities related to various types of mining.   In addition, the institute has funded domestic universities and colleges that provide mining engineering education, so that the institutions can guarantee the tenure of young professors and train graduate students for doctoral programs. 0
