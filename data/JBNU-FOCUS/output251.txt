In specific, students with disabilities are provided with special bedrooms, and they have priority when applying for dormitories.   Also, the university recently created an unobstructed walkway to build a pleasant environment for people with disabilities.   “We will spare no effort to minimize the chances of inconvenience so that these students enjoy their school life,” said Sang Yeol Park, the director of the Student Support Center for Disabilities. 0
