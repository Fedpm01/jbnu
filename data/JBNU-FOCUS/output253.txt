제목Student Receives Award for Electric Power Research                      | 2018-05-25 | 조회 6156본문 내용Seung-heon Song (master’s student, Power Grid Lab) was awarded the ‘outstanding paper’ at the Spring Conference 2018 hosted by the Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers (KIEE) Society of Electric Power Systems. The paper was evaluated as “one of the best cases of industry-university cooperation.”   At the conference, Song presented his research “A Study on the Required Capacity Assessment of BESS for Securing Transient Stability at the Fault on the Transmission Line Connecting the Large-scaled Power Plant” at the conference.   The study focuses on the resolution of the grid’s instability problem due to the derailment of the generator caused by breakdown of large-scale power plants, in the domestic power system conditions, where it is difficult to secure sufficient capacity of transmission lines despite the fact that large-scale power plants are concentrated in remote locations.   Applying BESS (Battery Energy Storage System), a battery electric storage with excellent speed and responsiveness, Song’s team proposed a method for estimating the appropriate capacity, and verified it through a simulation analysis applied to a failure prevention device of a large scale power generation complex on the East Coast of Korea.   The paper is a result of the management policy research project commissioned by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and conducted by the electrical grid lab of the Department of Electrical Engineering of CBNU.  0
