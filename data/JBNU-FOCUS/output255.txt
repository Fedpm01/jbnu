제목CBNU Keeps Its Position in Leiden Rankings                    Office of Information  | 2018-05-25 | 조회 7485본문 내용In the CWTS Leiden Rankings 2018, which evaluates the quality of the world’s academic publications, Chonbuk National University took first place among national comprehensive universities in the top 10% cited publication, reflecting the weight of the coauthorship, for three consecutive years since 2016.   The Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) has evaluated the science and technology impacts of 938 universities in the world which have published more than 1,000 international papers over the past four years.   The center announces the results of two evaluation methods: one includes the total number of publications evaluating the co-author's and independent papers at the same value, while the other adjusts the weights taking the number of co-authors into account (‘fractional counting’). The ranking has grown in importance because the fractional counting is clearer in evaluating the quality of publication.   Excluding subjective evaluation factors such as survey, it evaluates the ratio of the cited articles by the five disciplines using only the objective index of the number of citations, based on the Thomson Reuters DB from 2012 to 2015.   Chonbuk National University kept its position in this evaluation, especially in the ratio of top 10% papers in the field of mathematics, computer science, life science, and earth science.   In particular, CBNU has a steady increase in the total number of articles included in the Leiden Ranking Assessment: 5,232 articles in 2016 (2011 ~ 2014), 5,627 in in 2017 (2012 ~ 2015), and 5,874 in 2018 (2013 ~ 2016).  0
