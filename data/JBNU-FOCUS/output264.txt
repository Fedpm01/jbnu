제목Golden Hour to Save Sepsis Patient’s Life                    Office of Information  | 2018-09-27 | 조회 2798본문 내용Vibrio vulnificus sepsis is a summer disease with a high mortality rate. It occurs intensively during August and September when raw or undercooked seafood is consumed. Early diagnosis and treatment is directly linked to the patient's life.   Professors Jin Park (dermatology) and Chang-Seop Lee (internal medicine) of Chonbuk National University Medical School introduced their successful case of early detection and treatment of vibrio vulnificus sepsis in the July issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (IF 79.258), attracting the world’s attention.   The 71-year-old patient had giant hemorrhagic blisters on his left palm, wrist and the back of his hand at the time of presentation, 12 hours after eating uncooked seafood. After the team’s prompt diagnosis, orthopedic surgery and administration of antibiotics, the patient recovered well and was discharged from hospital.   According to Professor Lee, the discovery of a “large-sized blister” lesion is a typical sign of the disease, and detection is important when diagnosing the disease. “The initial characteristic lesions presented in our report can be a decisive factor for the early diagnosis and treatment of vibrio vulnificus sepsis.”   In the same journal in 2015, Lee introduced his research on skin lesions of tsutsugamushi disease, which is prevalent in autumn. Because the two diseases are common in the Jeollabuk-do province, clinical vigilance is even more important in the region.  0
