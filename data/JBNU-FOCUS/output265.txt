Most of the high performance piezoelectric materials currently used are rigid ceramic materials. Therefore, it has been a serious challenge when applying them to flexible electronic devices.   Jeong’s team fused the piezoelectric ceramic particles with the three-dimensional porous structure of plant cellulose to produce a porous piezoelectric ceramic material that is connected three-dimensionally.   The natural imitation piezoelectric ceramic material made in this uniform shape is finally made into a new piezoelectric composite material mixed with a polymer material.   Because the ceramics are all connected, they maintain the bending characteristics while effectively receiving the external mechanical force, which can dramatically improve the flexibility of conventional piezoelectric composites.   The study was conducted in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, USA, and Wuhan University of Technology, China, and the results were published in the August issue of Nano Energy (IF 13.12), which received attention from the academic community.   Jeong also developed a piezoelectric material using sponge structure, and participated in the formulation of related epidemiological theory. The contents were introduced in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A (IF 9.931) and Energy & Environmental Science (IF 30.067).  00180806_New Flexible Device Technology from Nature_grey.jpgCount : 59124280 K
