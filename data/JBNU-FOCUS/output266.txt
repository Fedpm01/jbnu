제목Virtual Musical Instrument for New Era                    Office of Information  | 2018-09-27 | 조회 3498본문 내용A technology to add ‘expressions’ to digitized Korean traditional music has been introduced.   Professor Byung O Kim’s team (Bureau of University-Industry Cooperation & Research) of Chonbuk National University has developed a new smart software to enrich the digital performance of Korean traditional music, based on the ‘PPM (Pattern, Phrases & Motif) technology’.   Using this technology, the team produced the music album Gasangnori and launched it online. The album contains four musical pieces, including ‘Gangwon-do Arirang’ and ‘Heemangga (The Hope Song)’.   While the conventional virtual instruments imitate musical sounds, the newly introduced music authoring tool enables expression. The software helps creators easily and conveniently reproduce Korean-style musical expression without studio recording of real musical instruments.   It not only provides samples and phrase sources, but also has a ‘motif function’ that enables the transformation and use of phrases according to the user's context. The technology is expected to enormously diversify the musical expression.   Each musical instrument is equipped with 1,000 single sound samples and 100 signature phrase samples of Korean traditional music. The vast data reproduces naturalistic musical performances, with the participation of professional musicians and Korean music majors to enhance the quality of the contents.   The technology will be commercialized when the research and development of percussion instruments is completed later in 2018. Currently five stringed instruments and five wind instruments are being beta tested, including Gayageum, the Korean zither with twelve strings, and the Daegeum, a large Korean bamboo flute.   The tool can also be widely used in the production of soundtracks of motion pictures, for ceremonies, educational materials and more, saving time and money. The music created with the software was also used for the opening ceremony of the Jeonju International Sori Festival 2018 and the animation ‘Lost in the Moonlight’ OST.   “Although fusion of genres such as hip-hop, electronic dance music (EDM) and jazz is being actively implemented in order to develop distinctive sound sources within the music industry, Korean music isn’t as commonly used in these genres,” said Prof. Kim. “With the new software you can easily reproduce the high quality of Korean traditional music even if you are not a professional musician, so it will contribute to boost the popularity of K-music.”   The development of technology was made possible with the support of the Korea Creative Content Agency.  00180810_Virtual Music Instrument to Open New K-pop Era_grey.jpgCount : 53231061 K
