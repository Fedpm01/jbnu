제목Whole Fruit Reduces Obesity Risk                      | 2018-09-27 | 조회 6436본문 내용As fruits contain sugar, whether or not fruit consumption induces obesity has been debated for a long time.   One of the world’s most popular weekly magazines, Time magazine, made reference for the second time to the research led by Professor Seong-Tshool Hong (Microbiology Department, Chonbuk National University Medical School) and colleagues, who proved whole-fruit eating reduces the risk of obesity.   For the research, the team collected big data on the effects of fruit intake on the human body from the academic publications and the internet, and combined the data with content information of each fruit ingredient.   They developed a method to interpret the big data from a new perspective and analyzed the relationship between fruit components and obesity. According to the results of the analysis, fruit sugar glucose and obesity are independent of each other, and the higher intake of high-acidity fruits helps lose more weight.   The study has been evaluated as a good example of how a global question can be answered by big data analysis.   Also, it is unusual for a particular scientific research to be introduced twice by Time, as even Nobel-winning research has rarely been covered by the magazine.  0
