제목ACS-Recognized Research on New Polymer                    Office of Information  | 2018-11-23 | 조회 5033본문 내용A heat transfer composite material made from conventional polymer materials of poor thermal conductivity has a low heat transfer quality.   In order to improve the downside of this feature, a Chonbuk National University team (Dept. of Polymer Nano Science & Technology) has developed a polymer material with a superb heat conductivity, which is easier to process.   The new material is expected to be applicable in various industries such as electronics, energy, and aerospace, where effective heat control is essential.   It is very unusual for a graduate student to be the main author of a study recognized by a world-wide journal. The results of the study were published as a cover paper in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (IF = 8.097, Top 7.82%) recently, one of the top academic journals in the field.   The research was made possible with the participation of Dong-Gue Kang, Hyeyoon Ko, Jahyeon Koo, Seok-In Lim, Jin Soo Kim, Yeon-Tae Yu, Cheul-Ro Lee, Namil Kim, and Kwang-Un Jeong, and the support of the Korean Ministry of Education and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF).  0
