Professor Lee Yong-cheol's team from the Department of Respiratory and Allergy Medicine at Chonbuk National University Hospital announced that the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma generally used as hypoglycemic agent for diabetic mellitus can be a new treatment for asthma. Professor Lee's team showed that Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma decreased inflammation and irritation of airways and increased the numerical value of Interleukin-10. This plays an important role in asthma treatment when they injected Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma, an antiinflammatory agent, into a nude mouse suffering from asthma. This result was published on a recent internet version of 'Molecular Pharmacology', a Science Citation Index(SCI) academic journal published by the Pharmacology and Experimental Therapy Society of the United States, and it was selected as a superior research paper. 
Professor Lee said, "I am proud of helping treat asthma, devastating disease."
