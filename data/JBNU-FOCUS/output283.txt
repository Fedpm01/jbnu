제목New Guideline for Hierarchical Hybrid Nanostructure Construction                    Office of Information  | 2019-01-29 | 조회 10757본문 내용A team led by Professor Kwang-Un Jeong (BK21 Plus Haptic Polymer Composite Research Team, and Dept. of Polymer-Nano Science and Technology) has developed a technique that can control hybrid high-dimensional nanostructures, drawing worldwide attention.   By adopting a host-guest system to apply the excellent photophysical properties of fullerene, the team was able to control the hybrid high-dimensional nanostructure of dendron-applied pyrene and fullerene nanoparticles with uniform orientation.   “Not only the orientation at the molecular level can be controlled, but also the properties of materials can be maximized by controlling the high dimensional structure between various two-molecule configurations,” said Minwook Park, one of the main authors.   It is expected to contribute to molecular design and synthesis by presenting a precise method for high dimensional hybrid structure control.   The research was carried out by Minwook Park, Dong-Gue Kang, Won-Jin Yoon, Yu-Jin Choi, Jahyeon Koo, Seok-In Lim and Kwang-Un Jeong with the support of the Korean Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Science and ICT.   The results were published in Small (IF = 9.598, TOP = 6.51%), one of the top journals in the field of materials science.  0
