제목Solvent-Free Green Synthesis of PLA Block Copolymers                    Office of Information  | 2019-01-29 | 조회 10247본문 내용For the first time in the world, researchers discovered a mechanochemical synthesis method of polylactic acid (PLA) block copolymers without using chemical solvent.   Solvent is the most commonly used in chemical synthesis and is the main cause of environmental pollution and accidents.   After two years of constant effort, Chonbuk National University undergraduates, Gue Seon Lee and Bo Reum Moon (Department of Chemistry, and Research Institute of Physics and Chemistry) and CBNU alumni Haemin Jeong (Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, and University of Science & Technology) have succeeded in synthesizing functional block copolymer polymers, the most representative material of bioactive polymers, in solid form using an eco-friendly method.   The research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea. Jihoon Shin and Jeung Gon Kim participated as corresponding authors.   The study results were covered in a recent online issue of Polymer Chemistry, published by Royal Society of Chemistry.  00181221_Solvent-Free Green Synthesis of PLA Block Copolymers.gifCount : 6818409 K
