제목Semiconductor with Lower Resistance and 100x Performance                      | 2019-06-10 | 조회 9499본문 내용When applying two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to conventional devices, high contact resistance between the TMDs and metal electrodes has always been a stumbling block.   CBNU Professor TaeWan Kim (Department of Electrical Engineering and Smart Grid Research Center) and his team have developed a technique that overcomes this problem and performs 100 times better than the existing 2D material-based semiconductors.   The researchers succeeded in fabricating a next-generation semiconductor device by depositing 2D TMDs on a large-area, high-uniformity wafer. This wafer is a substrate of a semiconductor integrated circuit and was used in combination with the development of phase transition technology.   “The new polymorphic structure, which is semiconductor and semimetal, forms a perfect ohmic contact between the two-dimensional semiconductor and the metal electrodes, and minimizes the resistance, thus achieving about 1,139 cm2 / V · s,” said Prof. Kim. It is a field effect carrier movement 100 times faster than the previously reported 2D semiconductor performance.    The research results are expected to dramatically speed up the commercialization of high-performance actuators with low power in semiconductors and displays. The study was published in ACS NANO, the world-renowned journal in nano science and technology.    With the participation of Yeungnam University and the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, the joint research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea.  0
