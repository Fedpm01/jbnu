This project is co-hosted by Jeollabuk-do and Chonbuk National University in order to find talented human resources in the field of cartoon and characters production and to attract provincial people's attention to cultural contents.
The curriculum consists of classes for producing characters and cartoons. The Department of Cultural Work in Jeollabuk-do donated 15 million won to this project. Trainees learn computer graphic and study 2D courses, a basic course of character design in classes for producing creative characters after mastering the basic course. Classes for producing cartoons are composed of collecting ideas for cartoons and the process of cartooning by hand. Later the trainees produce digital animation with a computer. "It is an uncommon chance to be educated free of charge by professional lecturers in the field of character and cartoon production. In addition, the program is very practical and it is applicable to other fields," said Choi Byoung-yeon, a researcher at the Local Digital Media Center, and he expected many students to join in this project. The "2005 Culture Contents Academy" will be open for sixteen days beginning December 9th and the classes will be at the Local Digital Media Center from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Alist of selected applicants will be announced on the webpage on December 2nd.
