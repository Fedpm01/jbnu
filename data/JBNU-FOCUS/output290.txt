It is the 'Challenge Boost Scholarship', not for the students with good grade but for those who want to challenge some area themselves.Since 2017, around 400 students have benefited from this scholarship per semester. It is also very rare for a special-purpose scholarship to be offered to such a big number of students. Each of the successful candidates is given one million won for presenting their self-designed challenge to the university, and share experiences afterwards.In March this year, CBNU selected 384 students to receive scholarships this semester. With the scholarship, students prepare for the contests they want, or perform various activities such as overseas field trips, extreme experiences, research and book publishing. In August, they will promote other students' challenging activities by sharing their experiences through presentation of results.In this way, CBNU helps students to set their dreams on their own, by empowering them to take concrete steps to implement goals. In particular, since the support is in the form of real money, it also has the advantage of being able to use it freely for activities that one wants.In addition, CBNU grants scholarships to students who engaged in various activities in ‘the Six Key Competences’ such as challenge, communication, creativity, personality, practicality and culture to celebrate the university's opening anniversary in October every year.  00도전역량강화장학금.jpgCount : 94637038 K
