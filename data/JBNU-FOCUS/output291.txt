The students in ‘Honors Residential College (HRC) Eco Floor Program’ distributed 60,000 varieties of vegetables and flower seedlings cultivated over the past several months.   With the start of the first semester, the students have cultivated various seedlings such as red-pepper, eggplant, beet, kale, cherry tomatoes and flowers, under the guidance of Professor Byung-mo Park in the Department of Bio Science & Rural Resources. It was an activity to foster the right personality of students and to help raise their challenge spirits through the experiential program of the comparative area in HRC program.   The giveaway event was to share the joy of young citizens’ achievements with the local society. About 500 people including students and local residents participated, and there was such a big response and a long line even before it started.   “We found it enjoyable to see the plants growing from seed through HRC Eco Floor activities,” said Ki-seok Jeong, a student in the Department of BioIndustrial Machinery Engineering. “I’m happy to share the seedlings raised by ourselves for a meaningful purpose in the community.”  0
