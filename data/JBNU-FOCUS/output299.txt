"Our aim is to contribute to making safer and more durable future vehicles." Los Alamos National Laboratory-Jeonbuk National University has been contributing to the development of local industries by establishing a cooperative system with various companies in the wind power, aviation, drones, carbon fiber and electronic parts fields, conducting multi-disciplinary industry-academic research. Also, it won a technology transfer contract for non-destructive inspection of national defense-related structures, and has been actively interacting with MAI Carbon in Germany, as well as Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States​. 0
