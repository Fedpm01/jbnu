This joint research team will receive €284,000 for 3 years until September 2023 to develop a smart sensor that can detect harmful bacteria or germs contained in drinking water in real time. The main goal of this research project is to create a smart biosensor that can accurately and quickly detect harmful viruses or bacteria contained in drinking water. The U.S. Air Force Research Institute will participate in this research project as an end-user.   "As the importance of virus detection has increased significantly in recent years, we expect to be able to quickly respond to biochemical terrorism and global pandemic situations by developing rapid and accurate detection technology through the implementation of this research project," said Prof. Kwang-Un Jeong.   “We expected that the research project can be carried out successfully through the combination of our plasmonic effect technology and Prof. Kwang-Un Jeong's liquid crystal synthesis and advanced nanostructure control technology,” said Prof. Luciano De Sio. 00201029_nanosps_jeong_1.pngCount : 63568767 K
