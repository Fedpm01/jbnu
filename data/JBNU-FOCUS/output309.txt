is working hard on research and treatment related to cerebrovascular disease
(stroke), dementia, and headache in the field of neurology. Since his
appointment as a professor in 2015, he has mainly studied cerebral infarction, and
since 2018, he has been conducting basic research on zinc fingers related to
cerebrovascular diseases. Since 2021, he has also undertaken research related
to artificial intelligence and big data in accordance with the trend of the 4th
industrial revolution. After his appointment as a professor, Professor Kang has
published more than 10 papers per year in the SCI (E) journal as a main author.
In the seven years since his appointment as a professor, he has published 73
SCI (E)-level papers, has received several excellent researcher awards, and is
one of the most notable researchers. Cerebrovascular disease and dementia are
academic fields that still need progress in diagnosis and treatment. These are
the fields that can help many patients through the development of new diagnoses
and treatments. Professor Kang's research is of great value because most his
research is related to ways to diagnose diseases more accurately and quickly or
to actively cope with cases that show unusual patterns. Through his research,
patients' satisfaction with their treatment results can be increased, and the
economic burden can be lowered through an appropriate treatment process through
the accuracy of diagnosis.   ▶EducationFeb 2018.  /  Chosun Univ. Graduate School,
