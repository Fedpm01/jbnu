advanced researchers in Korea in microbial-based pest control research. Through
his research on microbial pesticides, which began in 1999 when he graduated
from Seoul National University's Department of Agricultural Biology, Professor
Kim developed a product that can control gizzard worms, the biggest problem in
crop production, and commercialized it in 2017 as a product called
Chongchaessak. This product sold out three times in the first year of its
release, making it the biggest success story in the domestic eco-friendly
market so far. At the same time, he deciphered the entire genome of the
insecticidal microorganism ERL836 for the first time in Korea, creating an
opportunity to understand the molecular biological insecticidal mechanism. In addition, he is focusing on research
that can control aphids, mites, moths; the forest pest Monochamus alternatus,
which can spread serious wilt nematode; and Haemaphysalis longicornis and
mosquitoes that spread diseases. These pests can be controlled with existing
organic synthetic pesticides, but if environmental problems are considered,
research and development of safer control are urgently needed. Therefore,
Professor Kim's research focuses on the safe lives of residents through
eco-friendly pest control. This is why his research is drawing attention in the
era of carbon neutrality.  ​▶Education​2007  /  Seoul National Univ. Doctor of Insect
