research achievements in the fields of new material development and solar cell
application research. Two of his papers were cited more than 1,300 times
regarding a study that suggested the possibility of using highly conductive polymer
material as a component for transparent electrodes. Two other papers, which revealed
that graphene material can be used as an excellent interfacial layer material,
were cited more than 700 times in academic circles for producing
high-performance electronic devices. Another paper was cited more than 100
times regarding the process technology development and application technology based
on large-area liquid process for producing low-cost electronic devices. Professor Na's research on solar cells and
related new energy materials, which are some of the new and renewable energies
for the future, is closely related to our lives. The idea of solving the
environmental and energy depletion problems caused by fossil energy led him to
pursue research in this field. As a researcher who continues to take up the
challenge of developing new technologies, Professor Na hopes that his efforts
will have a positive impact on our lives and our future.  ▶Education​Feb 2010  /  Gwangju Institute of Science and
