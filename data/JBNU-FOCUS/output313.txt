research in the field of manufacturing electronic devices with stretchable and
flexible properties based on liquid metal that maintains a liquid form at room
temperature. He released related theses at ACS Applied Materials &
Interfaces (top 13% journal in the field of material science) published by
the American Chemical Society, at Advanced Science (top 5% journal in
the field of material science) published in Germany by Wiley, Advanced
Electronic Materials (top 16%), and Advanced Material Technologies
(top 18%). Recently, he published his research results in Journal of
Materials Chemistry A (top 6%) on energy storage and generation catalysts. Professor Park's research is noteworthy in
that it can go beyond the limits of the application range of rigid electronic
devices that existed before. The increasing number of flexible electronic
devices produced by Professor Park's team can be worn on the body and can
maintain electrical properties despite various stimuli, so they can be widely
used in future electronic devices. They can be widely used in wearable
healthcare devices that diagnose health conditions through analysis of sweat
and tears emitted from the body, for energy harvesting that can capture energy
emitted from various electronic devices, and for artificial skin of soft
robots.  ▶​Education​2013  /  RWTH Aachen University, Doctor of
