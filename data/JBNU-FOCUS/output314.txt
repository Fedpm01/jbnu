research in the field of innovative medical devices looking toward the next
five years and is focusing on research and development of key source
technologies to commercialize them. Currently, he is conducting a mechanical-biotechnology
convergence study that can diagnose and treat diseases quickly and accurately
through an external mechanical signal control system embedded in the human body
with various types of bio support manufactured by converting biopolymers and
metal materials into complex nanofibers. Specifically, he is conducting research
on the development of a drug delivery system operated by in vitro electromagnetism
using magnetic nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles based on bio-nanofiber support,
and of a microchip in blood for diagnosing metastatic cancer using artificial
intelligence. Through this study, he was honored by being selected for the cover
thesis of Advanced Functional Materials in 2019. It took only four years
to be selected for the cover thesis after he first published a paper in the
same journal in 2015, and since then, about one paper a year has been published
in journals over Impact Factor 15. Some of Professor Park's studies can be used for third
and fourth grade in vivo insertion-type innovative medical devices, and
nanoparticles can be applied to clinical trials after further safety and
effectiveness verification in the future, which can lead to innovation in the
medical device field. These studies are expected to be applied to the treatment
of various diseases, including cardiovascular disease and digestive cancer, and
to be actively used for wound treatment and smart drug delivery in the future.  ▶Education​Feb 2012  /  Jeonbuk National Univ. Doctor of Nano-Bio
