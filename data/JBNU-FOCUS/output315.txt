continuing her research on person-environment fit, diversity, organizational
culture, and human resource management that she started during her master's and
doctorate courses. As she conducted research with Professor Amy L.
Kristof-Brown of the University of Iowa, a world-renowned scholar in this
field, and published several papers in major journals and academic societies,
domestic fit research became her trademark. She received the Korea Research
Foundation's Best Paper Award in 2010 for her thesis related to the methodology
of organizational behavior, one of the main fields of business administration.
In addition, a paper edited from her Ph.D. thesis (group-level fit) was
published in 2015 in the Journal of Management, one of the best journals
in business administration, and she received the Best Gallup Academic Paper
Award for her paper on the subject of group-level fit at the Korean
Association of Survey Research in 2015. Professor Seong's research field can more
comprehensively accept the problem of conflict caused by the advancement of our
society from the perspective of diversity. In addition, her research can
provide a perspective that can accept and resolve the conflicts of our generation
with a supplementary fit perspective (similar people are better matched with each
other) and with a complementary fit perspective (different people are even
better matched by complementing each other well).   ▶EducationFeb 2010  /  Seoul National Univ. Doctor of Business
