addiction fields such as alcohol, drugs, games, and internet addiction, and
mental health fields such as suicide and trauma. Since 1987, she has conducted
research in the field of addiction and has continued research in parallel with working
in the field of The Korea Association of Mental Health Social Workers. During
this time, “addiction” has become her defining word. Therefore, through related
studies, she greatly influenced Korea's legal and mental health policies, and her
research has been used in actual business. She participated in enacting Korea’s
Mental Health Act in 1995. She also developed and supported a model of the mental
health center pilot project, which began in 1998, and contributed to the spread
of 780 mental health welfare centers nationwide. In addition, she is a
researcher who greatly contributed to the development of a model for community
alcohol counseling centers that began in 2002, and the law and model for gambling
problem management centers that began in 2004. In fact, Professor Yoon has been
involved in creating mental health welfare centers, addiction management
support centers, and gambling problem management centers, and is contributing
greatly to taking care of people's mental health and improving their quality of
life. Professor Yoon, who consistently emphasizes
to students that love for people must take precedence over research, recently
announced her plan to conduct intensive studies on trauma, loss, social
alienation, and isolation, including studies on refugees she is focusing on
recently.   ▶Education2010  /  Ewha Womans Univ. Doctor of Social
