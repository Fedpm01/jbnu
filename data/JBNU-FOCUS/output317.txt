liquid crystal device technology, a key technology that determines the quality
and cost of LCDs. Fringe-field switching (FFS), the liquid crystal technology
invented and developed by Professor Lee, is currently being applied to
high-definition LCDs. For this work, he was selected in 2008 as a SID Fellow,
which is granted to only 0.1% of the members of the International Society of
Display (SID), and in 2016, he was the first Korean to win the Jan Rajchman Prize.
Since he was appointed to Jeonbuk National University in 2001, he has been
studying liquid crystal technology and electronic data, producing several
papers and patents while also advising more than 130 masters and doctorate students,
contributing greatly to fostering younger students in the domestic display
field. Initially, all LCDs applied a liquid
crystal element called Twisted Nematic (TN), which proposed a new concept of
wide-view angle liquid crystal device because the image quality easily changes
depending on the angle. However, it could not be applied to portable displays
such as laptops and mobile phones because of its high driving voltage and low
light efficiency, a problem that Professor Seung Hee Lee solved. Professor Lee
proposed a wide-visual FFS device that can be applied to all high-definition
LCDs regardless of display size and power consumption, and succeeded in
developing products to promote Korean LCD technology to the world. Through this, his lab is recognized as a
representative liquid crystal technology research lab in Korea and is
conducting industry-academic research with many companies such as Samsung Display,
LG Display, Samsung Electronics, Merck, Dongwoo Chemical, and Q-sys, and is
conducting patent technology transfer.  ▶EducationDec. 1994
