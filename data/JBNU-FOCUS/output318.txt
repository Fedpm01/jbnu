develops source technology for brain diseases using artificial intelligence,
which is emerging as a core of the 4th industrial revolution. He is accomplishing
various academic achievements through research that combines the specialized
field of artificial intelligence with brain science to improve the quality of
human life. In particular, he is trying to identify the genes and biological
mechanisms that cause Alzheimer's, which have not yet been accurately
identified, and to develop new drugs based on the research results. Currently,
he is conducting research on cancer-causing genes using artificial
intelligence. Through such research on the development of
brain science source technology, Professor Chong has derived the results of much
of the necessary artificial intelligence technologies. He plans to use these
research results to discover Alzheimer's-related genes that have not yet been
identified and to reveal the mechanisms of the disease to develop new drugs to
treat it. Professor Chong’s research can greatly help
prevent personalized diseases by utilizing human genome data, a human genetic
map, and can improve human quality of life in various fields such as by
providing customized diets and health care. If artificial intelligence is applied to developing
new drugs in South Korea, which is a latecomer in this field, the cost and time
required for developing new drugs can be drastically reduced. As a researcher,
Professor Chong dreams of a day when South Korea will lead the world in
developing new drugs.  ▶EducationMay 1993
