will replace fossil fuels, is attracting attention as a clean energy source in
various industries. In particular, hydrogen production technology through water
decomposition is an effective clean energy technology. Professor Duy Thanh Tran
of Jeonbuk National University is a researcher who is doing advanced research
in this field. In the production of hydrogen through water
decomposition, precious-metal-based compounds such as platinum (Pt), ruthenium
dioxide (RuO2), and iridium dioxide (IrO2) are currently used as catalysts,
which result in high costs for industrial applications due to their scarcity.
Therefore, the core of the study is to replace precious metal compounds through
the development of new catalysts for practical water decomposition. To this end, Professor Duy Thanh Tran developed
a very practical complex called NiCoP/CSs to confirm high efficiency in green
hydrogen production, published a paper in the world journal Applied
Catalysis b Environment (Impact Factor: 19.503), and is in the process of
commercialization through technology transfer to companies. Another study
showed excellent water decomposition performance through electrode catalysts
based on Pt-Cu@CuxONWs/3DF, and this study was also published in a paper in the
global journal Nano Energy (Impact Factor: 17.88) and is reaching the
stage of commercialization through technology transfer to companies. Professor Duy Thanh Tran's recent interest
is the development of nanomaterials necessary for green hydrogen production.
These studies are viewed to be opening a new horizon for non-precious-metal catalysts
for energy conversion applications. Such successful research development is
expected to bring opportunities for advanced hydrogen production technologies
and market expansion along with green hydrogen energy in the hydrogen fuel cell
industry.   ▶Education​Sep. 2016
