The consultation guidance professor system is introduced to all departments in this year 2006. The system is similar to the guidance professor system in which professors guide the students in course, employment, and life by grade. The system had little effect and was abolished except some departments, but the consultation about employment course and support has been recommended to raise the rate of employment of Chonbuk National University students since last year, and it was decided to operate the system in all departments from this year.
Administration decided to support the system financially to achieve the desired effect. The budget for the system in 2006 was estimated at 120 million won, and it is allocated three times. Choi Seung-gyu, a staff member of Center for Career Development and Support, said, "The amount depends on the actual activities record of each department. We will set up a standard based on the departments' working result during the spring semester and the employment rate record collected in May and October every year."
