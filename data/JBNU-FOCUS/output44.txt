The General Students Association has started a new evaluation system since May 15th. Park Ji-min, leader of a team of strengthening competitiveness, said, "The old evaluation system was inefficient because students evaluated the lectures which they took formally just to check their grades, so the GSA visited class to get better evaluation on the lectures from the students."
The old evaluation system had 5~6 items whereas the new one has 17 items to reflect students' opinion more on if the lectures were not really difficult or easy, how were the professors' teaching methods, if the students took the classes well and so on. The 60 target evaluated lectures were chosen randomly, which is 10% of 611 elective classes.
The old evaluation system was done on the internet but the new one was done by the GSA visiting class to class, handing out the questionnaires to the students and collecting them. Mun Yeon-ju, sophomore of Department of Spanish-Latin American Language & Literature, said, "I think the new evaluation system has more specific items than the old one so it will reflect students' opinion more. I hope it can be reflected in the lectures."
Professors also participated in the new evaluation system. It will be done by June 3rd and the results will be on the homepage of the GSA in June. The results will be in a brochure with class schedule and hand out.					0
