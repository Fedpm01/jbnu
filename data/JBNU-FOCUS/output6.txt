The committee of Library Information & Policy is organized and run in accordance with Library Law number 12. It consists of 26 official and private members.
Accepting the opinion, operational efficiency is low due to the dispersed functional system, the committee is composed to reinforce the systematic decision of policy and cooperation among ministries and offices.
Professor Suh is the only member of the national university and Honam region, out of 13 private members.
Since he was employed at CBNU in 1986, Professor Suh has been actively dedicating his time and efforts to the development of a library culture. He now serves as the vice-president of the Korea Library Information society.					00서진원.jpgCount : 2264234 K
