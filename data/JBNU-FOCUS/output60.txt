CBNU's president Suh visited the National Assembly and met him on 8th. Representative Kang promised that he and his comrades would like to help CBNU's Zoonosis Institute, which is related to studying Brucella abortus and Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, to be the best among the Eastern Asia within his party's scope. 

For a long time CBNU's Zoonosis Institute had been designed by professors, especially professors in veterinary medicine. A dean and professors in veterinary medicine proposed to set up the institute to solve the problem, which were damages from farm households in Jeongeup due to Brucella abortus. 

Accepting their opinions, representative Kang undertook to establish the institute in CBNU, the central university in Jeollabukdo.					00d7d8c9d7714c0e81f7b37eeb5e5b8d79.jpgCount : 20156915 K
