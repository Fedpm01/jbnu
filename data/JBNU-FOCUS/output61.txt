President Suh was quoted as saying, "ARCs from Canada has the best technology in the field of SOFC(Solid Oxide Fuel Cells). Therefore, I expect that CBNU will develop technology related with fuel cells and finally its technique will become the supreme know-how in the world." 

CBNU will develop science, technology and R&D through this. In addition, Chollabukdo will support the foundation of the overseas institute and cooperate between CBNU and ARC. 

ARC founded in 1921 is the first state institute in Canada. Since its establishment, it has contributed to develop Alberta for 85 years.					0047f174116a07dd146704bd26ad4de3ca.jpgCount : 23152561 K
