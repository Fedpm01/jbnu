Therefore, he was invited in January, 31st to appreciate his great determination, and had a presentation event for books.  
Professor Lee had retired from his teaching life in 1992, and gave his collection to CBNU last month. He was quoted as saying, "It is the time to donate my all of the books collected during my teaching in CBNU for future use. It would be very great that many student read these and make their knowledge improve by using them." 
The majority of his collection is about Korean literature, especially contemporary literature, because it is his major. But there are various kinds of contents like books about philosophy, psychology, linguistics, photograph, sociology, and Pansori.
