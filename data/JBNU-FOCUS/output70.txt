Particularly, this agreement, fully supported by Ministry of Education, Culture and Science of Mongolia, will be expected to be a educational and cultural bridge between two countries.

This IDDP agreement undoubtedly will help us induce approximately 100~150 Mongolian Brain forces and foster them as a potential Mongolian leader each year.
The agreement means both universities’ students, who are qualified, can get a dual degree from both universities and also have a opportunity to work as an assistant at the graduate school.

CBNU is now considering a 70~80% tuition waiver program for the revitalization of IDDP and prepare the high quality of environment for studies including various scholarships. This IDDP agreement is set to be leverage for the world’s top 100 universities and an educational front-runner in Asia.					000d16d65ccf6340bc37d902d2bcc09b29.jpgCount : 24272491 K
