The president said to volunteers that this farm activity will help all of them face the status of farm squarely and understand farmers. He also said “I hope today’s sweat will be a great asset to your future”.

Yoo Ji Hye, one of the volunteers said, “I’m so glad to be of little help to them and we had a great time acquiring wisdom of life from our senior citizens.”

The farm voluntary activity, hosted by the student association of Chonbuk National University, covers 17 villages, 3 townships with 300 voluntary students divided into 30 groups, and will continue until July 4th.					00c5e7f077a5a68519408911fce3b1adce.jpgCount : 271587226 K
