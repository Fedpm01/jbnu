"It is my great pleasure to do something for my university, even though it is only a small amount of money. I hope this would be the 'apple of my eye' of a small-sum donation culture for the development of the university." 

It is great news that undergraduate student Park, Woo Chan had visited the Office for University Development and presented his desire to donate a regular donation. 

Mr. Park promised to donate the sum of 10,000 KRW every month and he is the first one to donate the designated donation amount in his lifetime. 

The Global Leader Project (GLP), run by the Office of Student Affairs and designed to give a momentum to the students, was a big occasion for him to donate. 

Last year, he joined the GLP with three of his friends and got a chance to see the donation culture of foreign universities during the summer vacation. 

He believed that donation is crucial to the development of a university and after seeing many examples in American universities, he was surprised that not only a vast amount but even a small-sum donation is being revitalized. 

Mr. Park said that if we focus our minds on the development of the university, CBNU will reach the world's top 100 university ranking very soon. 

President Suh, Geo Suk extolled Mr. Park on what he has done and said, " I am so proud to call Mr. Park our community member and I hope he becomes a great man to enhance the global status."					00cb82f12b619a3e526ba7795025c873a8.jpgCount : 431729247 K
