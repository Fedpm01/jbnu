제목Professor Lee, Jung-hee presents the methods for production and application of a promising new material, ‘Graphene,’ in the paper published in Progress in Polymer Science                    웹마스터  | 2011-03-10 | 조회 1453본문 내용						Dr. Lee Jung-hee accomplished a splendid achievement by having published his research paper in the world’s most prestigious polymer science journal, Progress in Polymer Science (Citation Index 23.753, 1.3% within or below PPS out of all SCI journals) 2 years in a row.
   
Last year, Dr. Lee’s research paper of the manufacturing method of ‘polyaniline’, a plastic that carries electricity, was published in the same journal.
   
This time, his paper, ‘Recent advances in graphene based polymer composites,’ introduced the production method of ‘Graphene’ and composite materials based on it, and received world-wide attention. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to the researches on ‘Graphene’. 
   
As nano-material, graphene has a structure of 0.7 nanometer thick planar sheet of carbon atoms (1nm is billionth of a meter). Until recently, the existence of this material was thought to be impossible, but, when the latest research by Andre Geim (Netherlands- 2010 Nobel Prize laureate in Physics) proved its existence, it is now considered being a leading futuristic material. 
   
Concentrated researches are in progress to apply the new material with excellent electric conductivity and mechanical property to various industries along with touch-screen and solar battery industries.
   
Especially, with its transparency and good electric conductivity, it has variety of capabilities that can practically be used in electronic data processors such as foldable computers. If it is to be used in semiconductors, data-processing can become 100 times faster than it is with the existing silicon semiconductor.

In this research, Professor Lee introduced a simple production method of chemically stabilized Graphene, presented its pros and cons, and suggested ways to produce polymer composites for its usage. Followed by this research, Professor Lee’s team is currently on a spur to pursue diverse researches using Graphene and is expected to produce universally superb research outcomes in developing transparent electrodes and nano-biosensors. 

Not only does this research outcome accelerate the carbon industry development plan in Jeonbuk province, but is hoped to confirm Jeonbuk as being the Mecca for carbon technology.					00db6b7d85426e7f1cf23e8c3a5a58c9f8.jpgCount : 196792 KBbd8b57673e96723067505132e5d18581.jpgCount : 17307170 K
