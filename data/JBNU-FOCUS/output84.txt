제목Professor Lee, Jung-hee presents the methods for production and application of a promising new material, ‘Graphene,’ in the paper published in Progress in Polymer Science                    Admin  | 2011-04-04 | 조회 4491본문 내용						Dr. Lee Jung-hee accomplished a splendid achievement by having published his research paper in the world’s most prestigious polymer science journal, Progress in Polymer Science (Citation Index 23.753, 1.3% within or below PPS out of all SCI journals) 2 years in a row.
   
Last year, Dr. Lee’s research paper of the manufacturing method of ‘polyaniline’, a plastic that carries electricity, was published in the same journal.
   
This time, his paper, ‘Recent advances in graphene based polymer composites,’ introduced the production method of ‘Graphene’ and composite materials based on it, and received world-wide attention. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to the researches on ‘Graphene’. 
   
As nano-material, graphene has a structure of 0.7 nanometer thick planar sheet of carbon atoms (1nm is billionth of a meter). Until recently, the existence of this material was thought to be impossible, but, when the latest research by Andre Geim (Netherlands- 2010 Nobel Prize laureate in Physics) proved its existence, it is now considered being a leading futuristic material. 					00db6b7d85426e7f1cf23e8c3a5a58c9f8_1.jpgCount : 196792 KBbd8b57673e96723067505132e5d18581_2.jpgCount : 18307170 K
