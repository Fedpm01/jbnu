The hero of this heart-moving story is a faculty, Kwon Oh Chae, in Student Affairs Office. Mr. Kwon had a devastating incident in last September that his son had a traffic accident. He received insurance money from his son's accident, and he visited Development Support Foundation on March 31st for donating partial insurance money. "I was very devastated when the accident happened, but I could have hope by lots of people's help and support, so I could rise to my feet again. I just want to return the favor that I have received back to the university." Mr. Kwon who underwent difficult experience has his own reason to donate. While he was working for the Student Affairs Office, he felt sympathy for his son-like students, and hoped that students would develop their talents with the same attitude that he had for his son. He also said that this will be the opportunity to have new hope for himself and his son. This is not Mr. Kwon's first donation. He has been keeping affection and appreciation to the university for a long time, and for the return of it, he has been participating in small-sum donation for years. Mr. Kwon said that "Having been through the big accident, I appreciated more to the colleagues and was attached more to the students in CBNU," and "It is not much, but I hope it will be useful to the students." President Suh Geo-Suk said that "I will not forget Mr. Kwon's affectionate donation, and make more effort to become a better school."					00권오채_1_1.jpgCount : 20106951 K
