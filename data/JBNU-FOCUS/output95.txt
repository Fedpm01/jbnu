I hope you will challenge yourselves and grow to become global leaders.” On July 21st, 11 AM, President Suh gave a special lecture at the Science Culture Center to 500 attendees of the Youth Science Vision Camp. On this day, President Suh presented a special lecture on the topic of "Dreams, Challenges and the Future - Global Leaders Fulfill Their Dreams" and emphasized the importance of setting goals and taking initiative. President Suh began by taking example of the relentless pursuit of the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics selection. He also compared prominent figures in history such as Bill Gates, Steven Spielberg, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and their tenacious, goal-oriented endeavors to achieve their dreams. President Suh said, "those who achieve their dreams have common characteristics: they start defining goals at a young age and strive to achieve those goals with perseverance, passion, ambitiousness and a positive attitude." He further explained that "in order to fulfill one's dreams, one has to set the goal of becoming the world's best at a particular field and work to achieve this by establishing a well structured plan."  He later added, "You will one day be the future of Korean society and lead the scientific community. I hope you will set the goal of becoming the world's greatest at your particular field and constantly challenge yourself to be the best that you can be." "A few years later, you will become college students, and as college students, you will work hard to realize your dreams. As a globally recognized school and regarded as the best teaching university in Korea, Chonbuk National University will be a part of your journey to realizing your dreams." President Suh concluded by saying, "The DNA composition between human beings and chimpanzees are 98.7% alike but that minute 1.3% difference is what greatly distinguishes human beings as creators of all things. Much like how this small change can make a big difference, I hope you will be able to gain a better grasp of your future dreams and foster a tenacious attitude through the Youth Science Vision Camp.   00서거석_총장_과학비전캠프에서_청소년을_대상으로_특강을_하고_있다.jpgCount : 22394918 K
