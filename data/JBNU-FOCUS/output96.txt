From 2005 to 2008, Prof. Choi worked at Harvard University’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center(BIDMC) as a post-graduate researcher. Thereafter from 2008, he became a full-time lecturer at Harvard Medical School, and this year he was offered an assistant professorship. Professor Choi was selected as an assistant professor by Harvard University because of his academic concentration in of Bioimaging, one of the most talked about research areas in the medical field today. Bioimaging is the field of examining biological functions and cellular and molecular activity through imaging modalities. It is an area of study that integrates a variety of fields such as biotechnology, chemistry, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. Prof. Choi is responsible for the utilization of Bioimaging to provide accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment at Harvard University BIDMC Molecular Imaging Center. His research in this field was initially featured in Nature Nanotechnology in 2007, and in 2009, was published in Nano Letters. In 2010, Prof. Choi had publications in both Nature Nanotechnology and Nature Biotechnology , two of the most prestigious academic journals. This year, his study concerning cancer diagnosis using fluorescence garnered a significant amount of attention through publications in Angewandte Chemie(German Journal for Applied Chemistry) Prof. Choi has also submitted fluorescent cancer diagnosis and treatment related research to Nature Medicine and is expecting attention and support from a wider scientific community. Recently, Prof. Choi, with the support of the National Cancer Institute, developed the near-infrared fluorescent material “ZW800-1.” It is pending approval by the Food and Drug administration to begin the first clinical trials in 53 years.If all goes to plan, by next year, Professor Choi’s invention will begin animal testing as well as clinical demonstrations. 00미국_하버드대학교_의대_교수로_임용된_최학수_전북대_동문.jpgCount : 2018862 K
