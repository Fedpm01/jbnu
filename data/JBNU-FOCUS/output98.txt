As one of the core universities in this region, CBNU is living up to its name by organizing and participating in community service activities that benefit the flood victims. Members of our university fixed the mud-filled town's water channels, and visited the locals door-to-door, reconstructing damaged walls and working determinedly for them. The students, in particular, sought to help out the elderly who live by themselves. They provided a helping hand wherever it was needed and shared a few words of encouragement to lift the town's spirit.                                       Additionally, our university provided 100 sacks of rice and established a scholarship for students who were affected by the flood, proving that CBNU realizes its responsibility as the key university in the Jeolla-do region.  On this day, Student Senate President, Yoon-Kwon Kim, was on site to participate and he said, "The least we could do to help the regions affected by the floods was to come down here and help the locals. It was a very meaningful day. We hope we were able to convey our compassion and support to the elders affected by the flood." President Suh added, "As a core university in this region, we must be responsible for the welfare of the people in this region. So we organized a community service program that brings together school employees, professors and students to help the recent flood victims. I hope we can be that spark of hope that gives the people here the strength to recover from this tragedy."   00서거석_총장을_비롯한_전북대_구성원들이_정읍_산외면_지역에서_수해복구_봉사활동을_펼쳤다_4.jpgCount : 23300795 K
