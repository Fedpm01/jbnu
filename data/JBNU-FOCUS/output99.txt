Exclusive to CBNU, the program sends the most number of students abroad on campus. Students spend one semester at their admitted sister university and study the local language through one-on-one and small classes. Additionally, students get to experience different cultures, all the while receiving 18 course credits.  Those who are admitted into the exchange program receive full sponsorship of tuition and round-trip airfare by the university. This fall semester, there will be a total of 191 students leaving on exchange to Sister Universities; 64 students to LaSalle University, 50 students to Cebu Doctor’s University, 74 students to Visayas University and three students leaving for Shenyang Jianzhu University.On August 26th, 2:30 PM at Choi Myeong Hyee Hall in the Liberal Arts Building No. 1, Participants of the program and their relatives were joined by President Geo-Suk Suh at the GLP welcoming ceremony and orientation. On this day, at the welcoming ceremony, students listened to an explanation of the program and were encouraged to make the most out of their opportunity to grow as global leaders. President Suh said “The Global Leader Project inaugurated at our university and it is the biggest program in the country that aims to develop global citizens. I hope you keep an open-mind during your semester abroad, and continually challenge yourself to realize the dream that you have been working for.” 00전북대_글로벌리더프로젝트_발대식.jpgCount : 28435841 K
