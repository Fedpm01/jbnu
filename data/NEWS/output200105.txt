g the universitiesaAmong the universitiesa in the Honam-district, CBNU’s Division of Business Administration acquired business education certification first from the Korean Association of Business Education Accreditation(KABEA). aBusiness education certification is a system to guarantee educational qualities by developing specialized education programs and offering them to students according to certification standards. This means that CBNU earns recognition for its educational qualities as an organization for educating business. It is especially meaningful that just 10 universities got this certification. aMoreover, KABEA gave high evaluations to the Business Administration’s creative programs, such as Assurance of Learning, the special CEO’s lecture, the point system for students’ portfolios and Action Learning, noting them as best practices that other universities need to benchmark. aMembers of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, such as Samsung, are driving for an additional point system for graduates acquiring business administration education certification, so this result will contribute to boost students’ competitiveness for employment.
