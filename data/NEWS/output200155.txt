a established 'traditional music' as an area of cultural study starting in 2009, and on November 18th, the first CBNU traditional music contest was held. Participants prided themselves on studying pansori and danso. In the nation, only CBNU established 'Pansori' and 'Practical Danso' classes, deciding that all students should take these compulsory classes. aTwo thousand students have taken these classes since 2008, and more than 1300 students learned pansori and danso in 2009. The faculty includes top-noted singers and performers, so the quality of classes was highly valued. aThis contest was divided into four fields, including Pansori (person, party) and Danso(person, party), with about 50 teams participating. aYi Hwa-dong, professor of the Department of Korean Music in CBNU, said, “Pansori and Danso classes are required subjects to graduate. It is the first trial in a nationwide university and it’s a pride of the school. We will promote this situation constantly for students and make efforts for CBNU to become a center of traditional culture.”
