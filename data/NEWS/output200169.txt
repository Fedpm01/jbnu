 isa enhancing its competitive power and index of globalization by contracting a scholarship exchange with universities of high reputation. The CBNU Talented Person Training Center of the New Reproductive Industry and Investigation Center of Solar Energy visited the Royal Institute of Technology, the best college of technology in Northern Europe; there, an agreement was made for cooperation in the field of solar batteries. Also, the two organizations signed an exchange agreement with Solid-state Electronics Division in Uppsala University, which had eight Nobel Prize winners over 600 years. Through this contract, both universities will send students and professors more than once in a year and will hold an International Forum on Sunlight together. Lee Sang-gwon, a professor of the Department of Semiconductor Technology who promoted the arrangement, said, "A continuous international cooperation will enlarge not only research of related areas but also student exchanging and credit. By this, it is expected that it can be a good chance to stand toe-to-toe with global prestigious schools in a variety of fields."
