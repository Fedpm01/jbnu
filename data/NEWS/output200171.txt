ju makgeollia, the new centre of Korean wave, has been exported to Japan and Australia since last year. Early this year, makgeolli was certified by the FDA and is advancing abroad. However, systematic study of makgeolli is inadequate. Therefore, the Jeonju Makgeolli Research Center nested at CBNU. The center will make good quality makgeolli through research, restore traditionalism, and nurture the brand for globalization. About ten professors of the Department of Food and Nutrition, the Department of Korean Language and Literature, the Department of Business Administration, and the Department of Clothing & Textiles will join the center specially for diverse study.
