 hasa decided to run a campus police unit for precaution of crime and an atmosphere conducive to academic pursuit. The campus police started on March 8th and acted on their mission. CBNU removed the fences around universe last year and made a park for an open-campus with citizens. In fact, although guards had worked up until now, a request was raised for campus police because of the limitation of the beat that the guards could cover. SO, CBNU set up the police control station on annex in the headquarters. They patrol all districts of the university every day. It is a great system which could cover any accident quickly, especially with help of the Deokjin police office & Deokjin fire station and hospital. The president of CBNU, Suh Geo-suk, said that he'd expect big roles of the campus police with the university atmosphere in precaution of crime which might happen.
