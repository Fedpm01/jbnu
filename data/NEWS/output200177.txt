teama of Professor Kang Seong-ho succeeded to detect a single enzyme molecule in 50nm (Nanopore) based on chemiluminescence, making them the first in the world. The result of the research was published in “Angewandte Chemie International” on March 29th. This single-molecule detection technology can be applied to livings’ various phenomenon in the level of single molecule, increasing accuracy and maximizing the enzyme fusion immunity detection method. This analysis received high praise for making a chance to new expand single enzyme research.
