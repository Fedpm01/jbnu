archers at CBNUa aroused an interest in the academic world through publishing a series of books which has assembled the results of recent investigations of Metal Oxide Nanostructures and Their Applications (MONTA). Han Yoon-bong, a professor of the Chemical Engineering Department, and Doctor Ahmad Umar, one of Hanâ€™s disciples, compiled the book in five volumes and recently published them through the American Scientific Publishers. The book, with 71 chapters, systematically considered the theories and experiments with regard to the properties and applications of all kinds of MONTA. It would be expected to have a great interest in related investigations, as it has useful information needed to apply to the research and application. Han was not only selected one of the top 100 honored scientists by the International Biographical Centre(IBC) in 2005, but also was awarded a grand prize on investigation two years in a row in CBNU.
