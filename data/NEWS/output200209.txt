Lifelonga Education Center of CBNU has been selected for the Reorganization of College Lifelong Education System, which is the second edition of Assistance Projects for Activating College Lifelong Education in 2010 among national universities. a“This selection will help the center to play a key role in organizing the community for regional lifelong education,” an official said. aProjects for activating college lifelong education are countermeasures of both the change in the social and economic situation and the increase in demand for new education methods due to low fertility, aging and the advent of a knowledge society. This projects will last three years, supporting to change student-oriented systems of college into adult-oriented. The center is going to try to offer residents a broader opportunity for lifelong education and plans to extend the program by establishing a connection system with the province of Jeollabuk-do.
