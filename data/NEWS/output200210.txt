The Jeonbuk HyangGyo Foundation pushed for establishing a national university right after the Korean War, when there were no schools for higher education, and created CBNU. To tribute to the memory of the Confucian scholars who made big contributions to found the university at that time, CBNU has erected a memorial stone and had an unveiling ceremony on May 14th in front of the CBNU museum. a"I'll never forget the predecessors who devoted their efforts to establish CBNU for educating excellent students," said CBNU President Suh Geo-suk. a"I'd like to say my thanks to CBNU, which grows as global university, for erecting a memorial stone to praise our predecessor's contributions," said Kim Doo-bong, who is the chief director of Jeonbuk HyangGyo Foundation. "I hope that CBNU will grow as a university which brings great honor to Korea and is distinguished in the world, going beyond a regional university."
