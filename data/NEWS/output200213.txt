 Byoung-young,a a professor of Advanced Materials Engineering at CBNU, has developed original technology that makes it possible to produce ultra-high-strength materials in an efficient way. Choi has become famous for presenting a paper at the conference and winning the grand prize from The Korean Institute of Metals and Materials. The research is meaningful in that it allows the mass-production of ultra-high-strength materials, as well as making the production economical. a“Through this research, it would be possible to utilize it in a variety of fields, like car steel sheets with economical mass-production, by making all complicated processing simple in producing ultra-high-strength materials,” Choi said.
