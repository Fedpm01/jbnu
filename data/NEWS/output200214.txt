academica world is focusing on Park Joon-bum, a professor of chemistry education in CBNU, as his thesis is continually published in international academic journals. aPark published a study of mechanism and the feature of the compound oxide nano catalyst which used platinum, gold and copper in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, whose Impact Factor is 8.2, and drew extraordinary attention. aParkâ€™s study, which has been co-studied with Brookhaven National Laboratory in the U.S., is expected to be good information for its related advanced studies. He also explained that the study could be applied to future household electronic appliances. aPark examined the study of the structure of nano-gold particles and catalyst activities that lie in compound oxide and published it in a universal academic journal last year for the very first time. He is still maintaining its study in related fields.
