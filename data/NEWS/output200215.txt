 verya pleased to make such a big deal like this in my first competition, by recommendation of a professor” said Jo Soo-bin, a graduate student in the Department of Music. Jo won the first prize for female university students in the National Music Competition, which took place in the Gunpo Culture and Art Center in Gyeonggi-do May 18th. Jo was highly complimented by judges on her Korean song ‘Dong-Shim-Cho,’ foreign song ‘Beim Schlafengehn’ (by R.Strauss), and her opera ‘Mad Scene.’ Jo has taken lessons from Professor Lee Eun-Hee for seven years, since she was freshman. a“Jo has the talents required for a singer, like voice, enough artistic sense, sensibility and a warm mind. So, she will get a better result if she devotes herself with this encouragement,” Professor Lee asserted. aMeanwhile, the celebration and its memorial concert are going to be held in the Gunpo Culture and Art Center on July 23rd.
