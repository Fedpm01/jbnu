 recently held the ‘2010 CBNU Establishment Road Show’ with the SMBA(Small and Medium Business Administration). In recent times, youth unemployment and job creation are on the rise to key policy. The establishment road show was arranged to vitalize university students’ establishment, to contribute to economic growth and to create new jobs for a second establishment boom. aUnder the theme of “an entrepreneurial spirit for successful CEOs”, the show was filled with a range of people including CBNU President Suh Geo-suk and concerned persons and students. Also, diverse events were slated, such as the successful CEO’s special lecture, an explanation of establishment support policy and quiz survival, and so on. a“This establishment road show serves to revitalize the regional economy by producing CEOs with a creative mind. After the establishment road show, I hope that many students have an open mind about establishment and challenge the establishment and the key of the regional economy,” President Suh said.
