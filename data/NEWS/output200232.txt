The participating students had a chance to learn the Korean language and culture personally. aIn the Korean language classes, they learn Korean and improve basic conversational abilities. In the afternoons, there were activities experiencing aspects of Korean culture such as Korean earthen vessels, food, taekwondo, calligraphy, folk music and traditional weddings. aLee Bok-ki, deputy vice-president for International Affairs, said, "This program was to confirm the close relationship between the sisterhood-related universities, and to inform about CBNU and Korean culture to other countries. I hope we make Korea known internationally through various Korean culture experiences."
