team of Professor Lee Sang-kwon, including Kim Dong-ju, Kim Tae-hong, Lee Seung-yong in the doctoral courseaand Seo Deok-won in the master’s course, has developed a chip for separating immunocyte to diagnose cancer early and posted it to Nano Letters(quotation index 9.991). aThis team performed experimentation with mice alongside Korea University. They succeeded in separating 'CD4+ T cells' more than 90% by using silicon nano line, so the academic world expects that it will open a new horizon in the cancer healing field. aThis team applied for a patent for their result and said that they would develop an “integrated portable nano line diagnosis chip” within two years with this technique.
