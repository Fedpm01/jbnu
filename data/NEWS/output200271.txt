He has donated a scholarship for students who study in difficult surroundings continuously for several years. His successive contribution to our university started in 2003. At that time, he decided to make a scholarship fund for the younger students who were trying to achieve their dreams in difficulty. CBNU calls it the “Kim Hyung-nyeon Scholarship” and grants it to students who devote themselves to learning. “I appreciate his contributions to CBNU and hope it would be the foundation of becoming a World Top 100 university,” said President Suh Geo-suk.
