		Lee Sook-yeon, a professor of Chinese language & literature at CBNU, was nominated for supporting translation, research, and publication of 2010 Korean literature by The Daesan Foundation. The Daesan Foundation’s project is designed to publish great Korean literary works abroad by translating into foreign languages: English, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, etc. Professor Lee is supposed to translate the best-selling novel ‘Go San Ja(古山子)’ by Park Beom-sin, into Chinese with Professor Kim Eun-hee, in the same department, for a year with the support of the foundation. It would be an opportunity for popularizing the beauty of Korean literature to foreign countries.
