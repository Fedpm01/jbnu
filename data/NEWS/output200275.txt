 students in the Department of Landscape Architecture won the best award in the 2010 Rural Amenity Environment Design Contest, which was held by the Rural Development Administration. This contest was prepared for the vitality of rural areas through recycling of beautiful rural villages and rural amenity sources. In this contest, the CBNU team suggested sustainable development of rural areas through restoring old port around the Geum River and making wetlands. The CBNU students who prepared this work since last winter attracted attention to present desirable sights for rural villages. aStudent Song Eun-ho said, “We shed new light on the history of rural villages and planned the program for sustainable development.” He also said, “Thanks to this award, it became a good chance to draw a future of rural areas which harmonizes with human, nature and culture.”
