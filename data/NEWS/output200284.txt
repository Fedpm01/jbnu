ctober 15th, 63 students who have done self-improvement The research of Prof. Lee Jung-hee (The Dept. of Polymer Nano Science and Technology) was published in ‘Progress in Polymer Science’, which is the world’s most prestigious journal in the field of Polymer Research. This paper received attention from the world for writing about manufacturing methods of material in the best interest of the world with ‘graphene’. aGraphene material as a new material in the future has excellent electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical properties. As such, graphene material has been focused on much in the area of touch screens as well as several other industries, including solar cells and so on. In this study, Lee gives a way of how to easily prepare chemically stable graphene and introduces the advantages and disadvantages. a a                         ▲ Prof. Lee Jung-heeaDue to this research, the development of the carbon industry in Chonbuk will be able to be further accelerated, and it is an opportunity to confirm that Chonbuk is a Mecca of carbon technology.a
