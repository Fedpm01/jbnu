NU students started to help Japan while a campaign to help Japanese people damaged by the big earthquake and tsunami spread out in many ways. The CBNU student council established a donation box and started a drive to raise donations, targeting faculty and students in front of the old gate. Next, students raised a fund in each college and sent precious donations to Japanese people. Also, CBNU President Suh Geo-suk sent a consolation letter and consoled our sister-university, located in Sendai city, which has been damaged a lot. “We saw Japan’s miserable situation, so our students decided to raise donations spontaneously with the mind of helping Japan. Therefore, we want to give power to Japan,” said Kim Yoon-kwon, CBNU student president.a
