school staff member donated his son’s accident insurance for other students, despite his sadness. The hero of the touching story is Kwon Ou-chae, who is working in the Student Affairs Office. “When my son had such an accident it felt like the sky fell, but many coworkers helped and cheered me up, so I could feel healed by them. Now I want to give back the valuable support,” Kwon said. Since his work has been related to students since old times, he became more concerned with them and hoped that they would grow to be talented. He underlined that such a donation would create an opportunity to give hope to poor students. aFurthermore, this donation is not the first for him. He also has joined a small contribution campaign for several years. He said he began to have a stronger attachment to his job, students and CBNU through this accident and the contribution. “Recalling his deep affection to our University, CBNU will try to repay students more for his consideration,” CBNU president Suh Geo-suk said. a
