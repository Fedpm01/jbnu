NU researcher recently found a fundamental clue to solve sterility because of reduced motility of sperm. aThe research team of Professor Kim U-hyeon investigated the function of protein in affecting the movement of sperm. The research was announced with the cover thesis of 'Science Signaling.’ aThis journal is an online journal which publishes only one to three excellent theses related with signals. This is the first time for a published thesis by a Korean researcher. The research is expected to achieve a triumph in solving the problem of the man's sterility fundamentally. a This team found that the protein found in sperm is the essential element for raising the calcium concentration and motility of sperm through experiments on human sperm and mice. Professor Kim said, "I expect to open the way for solving man’s sterility by developing a material which revitalizes the calcium signal related to sperm’s movement."
