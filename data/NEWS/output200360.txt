st the serious social problem of successive college students' suicides, CBNU is receiving fervent response for amanaging various consultant programs. These help manage student's stable campus lives and career searches. aCBNU has placed a counseling center in the dormitory and appointed a psychiatrist, Yang Jong-cheol, a professor in the Medical School, as deputy curator. aÂ aEven though many universities manage consultant programs, it is rare that a psychiatrist counsels students. This is to prevent university students' worry and to promote better lives for them. For this reason, CBNU installed a consultant center for health care in the Sae-Bit second dormitory on the first floor. The center proceeds with counseling after accepting applications every Tuesday from 5:30p.m. to 6:30 p.m. aFurthermore, CBNU heads a consultant program related to getting a job and career. Students can receive advice from an expert one-on-one about how to write papers, make resumes in English and make their images. Above all, it is helpful for students' campus lives in that it continuously conducts an aptitude test and personality test.
