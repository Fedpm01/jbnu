result of a survey which the JoongAng Ilbo and Research & Research  conducted showed that satisfaction of CBNU students was very high. CBNU held the ninth rank from all over the country in comprehensive satisfaction and ranked second only to Seoul National University among the national universities. According to the survey, CBNU took fifth place in satisfaction with scholarship, welfare benefits and school restaurant prices, and it came in eighth for faculty’s kindness. Also, it took the second rank in satisfaction with tuition in the national university system. Overall, the satisfaction of CBNU students was very high. The reason is that CBNU froze tuition three years in a row and managed various scholarship systems. Also, CBNU built a new dormitory and remodeled its restaurants.
