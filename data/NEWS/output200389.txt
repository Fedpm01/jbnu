CBNU Wildlife Research Center, which has been leading ecosystem restoration through rescue work and caring for wildlife, recently released five eagle owls into nature. Five eagle owls were rescued last year and received treatment in the center. Finally, they have returned to nature. Many people participated at the release site, and they talked about the importance of ecosystem protection. Professor Lee Hae-beom, the head of the CBNU Wildlife Research Center, said, “This event served to share the importance of wildlife protection. I hope many people join the wildlife protection campaign.”
