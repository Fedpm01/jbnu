graduate student in the molecular biotechnology laboratory, Le Thai-Hoang, has been acknowledged for his outstanding paper. He won an ‘Excellent Paper Award’ at the Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology this year. He presented his research work titled ‘Development of Transgenic Daphnia magna Expressing Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein’.aArranging a new genetic system, this is the study to develop a genetically modified water flea (magna) that can measure the degree of contamination in water as increasing or decreasing with the degree in fluorescent material.a aThe result of his study is expected to suggest new techniques in measurement for preventing environmental pollution and its management. Based on that research, Le Thai-Hoang had brilliant outcome by approving four SCI papers, three papers presented at domestic meetings and two patent applications.
