essora Uh-Hyun Kima ain the Medical School was selected as to receive the 'Pfizer Medical Research Award‘, which is one of the most prestigious prizes in Korea.a a a a a'Pfizer Medical Research Award’ established by the 'National Academy of Medicine of Korea' and ‘Pfizer Korea’ is given to an individual who has made outstanding contributions to research in medical sciences. a a a a aProfessor Kim has devoted the past 20 years to investigate the function of Caa2+a signaling molecules. He recently published his groups’ discovery of several proteins involved in Caa2+a signaling for the sperm motility. When sperm acquire these proteins from prostasomes secreted by the prostate gland, Caa2+a signals are generated for the motility of sperm in response to progesterone. This result may help solving the problem of the male infertility. Professor Kim said, "I will do my best in my research continuously and I hope our findings can open up new directions for therapeutic intervention in sterile men"a a
