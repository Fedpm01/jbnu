		The students in the Department of Architectural Engineering were presented the grand prize in the 2011 POSCO Steel Design Fest for the work of ´MSP: Moving Steel Park’. The contest exhibition topic was ‘Warm Park Designed by Steel’, aiming to find a fresh idea and to cultivate the manpower of steel. In the contest, CBNU students proposed a new park paradigm, ‘Moving Steel Park’, which is suitable through steel and ever-present computing. They added the concept of moving the tall building made of steel to make people contact it ‘anytime, anywhere’, so they got good comments from jurors. A tutoring professor said, “Moving Steel Park shows an open place which is always beside us and which people can visit easily.”
