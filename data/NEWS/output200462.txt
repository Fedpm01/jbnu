		A new history to CBNU Museum has begun! The opening ceremony of the new museum was held on November 23rd, 2011. The construction was completed after a construction plan that started back in 2004.  The museum is now a highly modernized structure with first-level basement to third floor totalling 6,521㎡.aThe new museum building has great galleries consisting of historical relics from prehistoric ages to the Joseon Dynasty. Furthermore, the Donated Relic Room has many invaluable artifacts selected from 1,600 various donations.aAt the ceremony, there was a planned celebration exhibition that focused on the existence of old MAHAN territory from the excavations. Lots of unearthed ironmongery and earthenware gave people a chance to feel the old society with the ancient culture MAHAN people once enjoyed.aAs a cultural hub that communicates with the local society, the role of the museum in representing culture is looked on as being vital for the future.
