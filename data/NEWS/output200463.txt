of the "Han style" industries in Jeonju is the traditional Korean-style house industry. However, it still makes slow progress. A big hindrance for improving the industry is to train the specialists in that field. There were cases in which some workers distorted traditional houses because of lack of understanding in the construction knowledge.aNevertheless, CBNU has been struggling to offer official education for Korean-style house construction since last year. The university has become the center of the education front. Skillful architects are hired and there will be a contest for remodeling the campus in Korean-style. CBNU is also going to establish a new department relative to Hanok (Korean-style house) in its graduate school.aThus, the Hanok industry and Korean wave industry are expected to be more promoted as CBNU educates and teaches on the subject. Since the university has started to support local industry, there will be positive effects on both the regional economy and the university.
