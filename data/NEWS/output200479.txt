Chonbuk National University works to fulfill its duty of National University through helping neighbors in need.a a aAt the end of last year, CBNU sent bazaar donations to neighbors in need.a a aAlso, clothes and books that it didn’t sell at the bazaar were used as aid items through foreign community service for loving yet underprivileged people over the world.a a aThese days, the employee conference had time to encourage and deliver scholarships to child heads of household.a a aThis scholarship gave encouragement and strength for children who lead houses and study.a a aThrough continually visiting houses to check electric installation, housing life styles, and home help, we gave students tremendous power.a a aPresident Geo-Suk Suh said, “I am really glad that we can help a neighbor in need with our warm hearts. I will show strength not only to build a society service system but also a culture of donation settlement.”a
