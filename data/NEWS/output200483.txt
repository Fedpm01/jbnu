“Graghene”, by its characteristics, is 0.7 nanometers thick, and 100 times stronger than steel. However, it’s 100 times better at conducting electricity than copper, with an electron transfer 100 times better than semiconductor silicon.a a aLee Joong-hee’s research team, Tapas Kuila, announced a thesis to the academic world most interested in ‘Graghene’ research.a a aThey announced a thesis named “Preparation and Characterization of High Performance LLDPE/Graphene Nanocomposites” at PFAM XX.a a aThis research is the technology of making nano-composite material using “Graphene”.a a a“Graphene” is made up of atomic units of Carbon. This existence was impossible until a recent date; a anot long ago, a athe “Graphene” existence came out in the world, so it is in the spotlight as a new material of the future through Geim, Andre research.a a aThis new material has excellent properties of matter, electrical conductivity and clarity, so in the future, it is expected to be used as a possible film of production, lamination and antistatic material.a
