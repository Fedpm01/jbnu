012, CBNU student scholarships approached approximately 50% compared with total tuition fees, so in practical terms, the university has reduced tuition by half. The school officials said, “This year, although we reduced tuition by 5.6%, the scholarships increased by 14.6 billion won. So the scholarships approached 48.2% compared with tuition fees.” Last year, CBNU ranked first among all the National Universities for ‘satisfaction with benefits and scholarships’ and second for ‘satisfaction with tuition fees’. CBNU confidently expects higher student satisfaction because of the increase in scholarship. President Suh Geo-suk said, “CBNU decreased tuition out of regard for the painful burden of the students and parents although we realized the subsistence level of the tuition fee. We fulfilled the goal to reduce tuition by half.” a
