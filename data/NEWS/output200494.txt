The importance of IBC is being strengthened, since it has held international conferences to research common cultural subjects, inviting the world's greatest scholars.

Also, he published about 40 theses, including ten theses in the SCI level, as well as six books. Now he tries to train professional and technical people in environmentally friendly architectural fields such as the building of Han-Ok housing.
