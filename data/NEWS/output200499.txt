essor Khang Gil-son garnered extreme interest because he published the book ‘Handbook of Intelligent Scaffold for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine’ as a first. Professor Khang published the handbook by receiving financial funds from the school. The book, composed of a total of 45 chapters, introduced the scaffold, which is an essential ingredient to develop bio organs and tissues using stem cell groups. In particular, this book introduced useful bits of information like recently researched result and research applications to apply to the bio organ study. As such, we expect that it will help a lot of researchers around the world.
