Science Education Institute for the Gifted received an ‘A’ score from the Korea Foundation for the Advancement of Science and Creativity (KOFAC). This shows that CBNU has outstanding competence in gifted and talented education. This institute started in 1998. It works for discovering talent and developing a fruitful course of study and curriculum. As a result, it is acting as a differentiated service for students. Last year, it organized a science and English school for a neglected class of people and constructed a methodical system for discovering talented students. Ahn Byoung-joon, director, says, “It was possible because of the school parents who have supported us. From now on, the CBNU Science Education Institute for the Gifted will try even harder.”
