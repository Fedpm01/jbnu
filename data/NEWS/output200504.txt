s expected that cancer can be rapidly diagnosed through dropping blood in a kit. The research team of Lee Sang-Kwon, a professor in the department of Semiconductor Science & Technology, achieved important results. That is, they succeeded in development of a diagnostic chip that can check whether cancer is spreading or not in the body with very little blood and low costs. Also, they announced the development of a cell-separating chip that can separate immunocytes using Quartz Nanopillar structure. This study was published online in ‘Nanoscale’, which is a global professional journal. Owing to recognized superiority of this study, it was also published on the cover of the offline ‘Nanoscale’.
