’t it a dereliction of duty that a man wants to be a father without any effort or preparation?” Five CBNU students in the Department of Child Studies have published a book. Those five girls won the grand prize of a writing encouragement program in the university education capacity enhancement project. They could publish their first writing with the support of CBNU. The students thought the establishment of the role of father was required. In particular, they considered the desirable perception for a young man who will become a father. The book pointed to active fatherhood for not only the family but itself figure. Covering the concern of being a father, the book reflects to the reader as one’s sons and daughters with sympathy for the father’s torment. To prove this, they interviewed over a thousand fathers, potential fathers, and women. The book, which is intended as preparation material for a father, shows their endeavor and passion vividly.
