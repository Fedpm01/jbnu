International Summer Camp at CBNU finished successfully. The program allowed foreign students, from the U.S.A, U.K., France, Spain, Japan and others, to experience Korean culture and take lectures on it in order to get a grade. aBy taking this course, it was reported that CBNU spread the excellence of Korean culture to the world and enhanced CBNU’s position. aAt the graduation ceremony, where every student wore a hanbok, President Suh Geo-suk gave each a certificate. The foreign students who practiced for weeks did a nice performance of K-pop and drew applause. a“I participated in the summer program at CBNU with much interest in Korea; the meaningful lectures and culture experience fascinated me. Thanks to CBNU for such a good program, and I will keep this feeling for myself,” Ashley Wirtz, a Boise State University student, said.
