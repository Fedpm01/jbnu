 researchers presented a new treatment which can promote bone formation by transplanting stem cells to the location of bone deficit. The heroes are Kim Jeong-ryeol, Kang Kyu-yun, and Park Byeong-hyeon, all of whom are professors in the Medical School.aFor this research they did an experiment by first making a bone deficit in an animal's shinbone. They then extracted fat stem cells from it and cultured them at the body absorptiveness scaffold, transplanting them back to the area of bone deficit. aIn the results, they showed that in the area of bone deficit, bone formation is promoted, and they presented how the bone agglutination is promoted. aFurthermore, through this result they achieved inspiring deeds of publishing their research in BONE, a journal with the world's leading authority in orthopedics, for four years consecutively. They have also been acknowledged for their research worldwide through the receiving of the best paper award from the European Organization of Infant Orthopedic Science for two years consecutively.
