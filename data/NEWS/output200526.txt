 sent the nation's largest amount of students to help rural communities which are short-handed. Students went on volunteering trips to rural communities after having a ceremony on July 7th. This year about 1,600 students volunteered, and it was the biggest number in the history of CBNU. aAs CBNU opened its new campus in Gochang city, students were volunteering in a farming village as well as fixing a village in Gochang for extending a warm helping hand to many regions as a prestigious local university. aMeanwhile, on July 7th, CBNU President Suh Geo-suk joined the volunteering. President Suh visited Jinan-gunâ€™s Bangwha village and Anbang village to encourage students who worked hard at volunteering. He participated by drawing on the wall for the village's environmental cleanup and doing weeding. Also, he had personal talks with inhabitants of village and students.a"I hope this volunteering becomes a chance to face the difficult reality of rural communities and understand farmers' agony," said president Suh. He emphasized, "Today's effort will be a valuable experience. I encourage CBNU students who do volunteer spontaneously to feel the preciousness of sweating and to let people know CBNU's superiority. I hope that students understand the reality of rural communities and learn many things there."
