 students in the Department of Architectural Engineering were recently awarded the first prize in the Concrete Technology Contest by the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards and the Korea Concrete Institute. Our university team was in third place in last year. They were well received in terms of liquidity of concrete and high strength. In addition, panels evaluated them highly on accuracy and degree of precision. This contest evaluates the economic feasibility, degree of precision, and high-intensity on the quality of concrete.
