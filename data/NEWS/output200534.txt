essor Shim Gyu-hwan revealed that Sigetronics, which was established by the school laboratory, developed an ESD/EMI Filter which is the core material of wireless communications and made a highly effective display with the most highly effective function in the world. aThe static electricity/electromagnetism filter is the core component which minimizes the electromagnetic interruption (EMI) of the high speed line of communication.aIt also has features that minimize the size of the components and make a forwarding speed faster than 500Mbps so that it can deal with protection of a communicative circuit by applying the high-tech semiconductor to the name of the IPD technique. aAccording to professor Shim, the recently developed electromagnetic filter is the first product in our nation which can work especially by adopting original TVS (Transient Voltage Suppressor). He will concentrate on high value-added products by developing specially made goods as well as goods for wireless communication.
