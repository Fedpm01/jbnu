 is operating a culture and art education program for multicultural students and parents in Jeollabuk-do. This program is offered by the College of Art and the Art Development Institution. aAs the number of multicultural families increased, CBNU came up with this program to encourage them to become members of Korean society. The program allows them to experience Korean traditions. Also, to motivate and let them gain some achievement, they plan to display their works at the institution. In addition, CBNU assigned excellent experts from the Department of Korean Music and Fine Art as its instructors in this program to provide a high quality of education. aThe Dean of the College of Art, Park In-hyun, said, “It is expected to encourage the immigrants’ cultural adaptation and to bring a healing effect to them through cultural communication.”
