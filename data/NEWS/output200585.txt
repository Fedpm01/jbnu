surroundings of the College of Liberal Arts are attracting students, professors and locals. It is well-organized and beautiful, so it has become popular as a healing space. aThis space was made through the ‘Green Clean Movement of the College of Liberal Arts’ that began in 2003. Students have volunteered to do it, and professors have supported this with financial help. They donated 30 million won, asking for it to be used as a fund for scholarships which are given to students who participated in making the environment beautiful. They also expect to continue the movement while managing this fund systematically and giving more scholarships. aProfessor Hahm Han-hee said, "The faculty and students have cultivated the College of Arts surroundings beautifully so far. To spread this movement, we prepare finances for scholarship. I hope that this scholarship will be developed more systematically so students can feel proud of themselves."
