arch 27th, Jeil Rotary Club, which is one of the International Rotary Clubs, delivered a development fund of 50 million won to CBNU in order to encourage and inspire students who volunteer. The International Rotary operates ‘Rotaract’, a volunteer agency consisting only of students, and this foundation is also for creating a ‘Rotaract’ in CBNU and supporting it. A scholarship is also going to be provided to students who volunteer with strong beliefs. a“CBNU assigns Community Service as a compulsory subject, and it motivates students to volunteer a lot. I hope this foundation spreads the volunteering spirit to all of the students in CBNU as well,” said the Head of Jeil Rotary Club.
