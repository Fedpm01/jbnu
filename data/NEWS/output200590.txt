ntly, Professor Bang Keuk-soo’s team in the Dept. of Chinese Medicine Resource invented a new technology that can increase licorice production. This new technology reduces the breeding periods of licorices from four or five years to two or three years by using Light Emitting Diodes (LED). This new technology is expected to contribute to our society in many ways. First of all, it can increase farm income. It is easy to cultivate licorice by using this technology, compared with the normal breeding method. It also can reduce the expenses of breeding licorice and increase the production. This new technology can increase glycyrrhizin content in licorice, too. Glycyrrhizin is a component of licorice which can treat diseases like cancer and hardening of arteries, so it can help to cultivate high quality licorice. In addition, Bang’s research team is planning to conduct additional research such as investigation of new natural medicines by using this technology. Professor Bang said, ”This new technology can contribute to the local and agricultural profits. Furthermore, I’ll make efforts to invent new medicines by using it.”
