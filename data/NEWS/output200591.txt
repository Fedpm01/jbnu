 held a Youth Job Concert for Youth Job Creation and Industry-University cooperation on March 25th. Representatives of Jeollabuk-do and many students participated in this concert. In particular, CBNU Vice President Jeong Hang-geun, Jeonbuk Governor Kim Wan-joo, and Jeonju Mayor Song Ha-jin had a friendly conversation with students who are preparing for employment. aMayor Song said, “To get a good job, young men need to get a sense of balance and the ability for viewing the world impartially. If students decide what they want to do and do their best to achieve it, they will get good jobs.” aVice president Jeong said, "CBNU gives an 'Understanding of Small and Medium Business' lecture to provide employment information. Also, I ask Jeollabuk-do to inform students about small and medium business in our province.” aOn that day, CBNU, Jeollabuk-do and Jeonju had an industry-academy-government agreement for supporting employment of college students. Through this, CBNU students will get jobs more stably.
