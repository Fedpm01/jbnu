 researchers have developed the first tissue regeneration progress checking technology without extraction of the spotlighted organization. Professor Khang Gil-son and his colleagues in the Department of Polymer-Nano Science and Technology developed a method of checking tissue’s regeneration by using a fluorescent imaging method that could see the phenomenon in vivo as projection. This study was achieved through international joint research by the team led by Professor Choi Hak-soo, who served as an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School after graduating CBNU, and the team of Professor Lee Sang-jin in Wake Forest Medical School. The study was reported in the online version of ‘Scientific Reports’, which is Nature’s sister publication. aThe research also created a great sensation in world academia. With this study, the team of professor Khang is expecting to contribute to the field of bio organs for the application of regenerating medicine from musculoskeletal structure organ systems such as bone, cartilage and discs to functional organs like the regeneration of the injured spinal cord, nerve regeneration of light and olfactory sense.
