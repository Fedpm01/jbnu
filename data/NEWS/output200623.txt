uly 19th, at Jinsudang, hundreds of Korean students and foreign students said farewell to each other. Starting July 1st, CBNU held an international summer school for three weeks, ending with a completion ceremony. At the ceremony, vice president Jeoung Hang-geun gave each student a certificate and said, “I hope the time spent at CBNU becomes a wonderful memory of yours. We will continually improve this program to globalize our school.”Students who participatedin the ceremony made a speech about what they had experienced and performed aK-POP dance. This year, 52 students from theUnited States, theUnited Kingdom, Spain, France, theNetherlands, and Japan participated in the program. This international summer school is a program which invites foreign students from sister schools every summer vacation. Korean students can take classes with them. Also, they go out to the Hanok village to experience Korean culture. This counts as extra credit toward their grade-point averages.
