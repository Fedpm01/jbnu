 studentsin the Department of Chinese Language & Literature were recently selected as ‘Korea-Taiwan Youth Supporters’. The Taiwanese government has been implementing this youth supporter project for enforcing interchange cooperation between Korea and Taiwan. Polaris, the team of CBNU students, consists of four members: Kim Young-woo, Kim Dae-min, Kim Sang-woo, and Han Gi-hong. The Polaris team expects the project to make an international cultural exchange and to enhance friendship through SNS updates made right after they experience every nook and corner in Taiwan. Student Kim Young-woo said, “We titled our project, ‘Journey to Ethnic Minority’s Sorrow’, so we will be able to sympathize with their afflictions. Also, we will do our best as a bridge regarding an exchange of culture or friendship promotion between our two nations.”
