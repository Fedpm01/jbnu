rder to prevent crops from a virus which is called AIDS, by developing the pest control chemicals, the Plant Medical Research Center(PMRC) of CBNU engaged in a contract with Biotech Idea Group(BIG), which is a promising firm for developing organic agro-materials. Plant virus causes serious problems regarding quality and quantity of crops. Recently, due to increasing international trade, there have been more and more foreign pathogenic plant viruses which have never existed before. Until now, there was no effective method to combat these plant viruses. Through joint research between PMRC and BIG, researchers expect to develop chemicals against a wide-range of viruses or bacteria. Besides the research, the entities intend to cooperate with CBNU students.
