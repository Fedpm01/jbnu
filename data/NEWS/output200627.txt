recent developments of CBNU seem to be more unusual to our university alumni living abroad. Alumni living in New York, Chicago and LA in the United States, as well as in China and Indonesia, actively support the development of CBNU. Recently, 5,000 dollars was sent from about twenty alumni in Indonesia to use for the development of CBNU. This donation was made through a meeting with the president of the alumni association in Indonesia and Professor Jeon Je-seong in the Department of Political Science and Diplomacy, who was visiting the branch of Miwon in Indonesia in the search. The president of the alumni association in Indonesia said, "The alumni doing business in a far foreign land want to hear the news of their alma mater growing as a global university. We actively turned out for the development fund-raising to help a little bit." He also said, "From this, we will try to be a force to the development of CBNU and to announce the fact that the alumni living abroad are in full activity for the development of CBNU by gathering their hearts."
