study of high temperature plasma at CBNU has expanded to the study of nuclear fusion and aerospace. Recently, the world’s fifth application study center of high temperature plasma in CBNU was selected as a cooperation-research managing department in the ‘2013 Nuclear Fusion Basic Research and Manpower Training Support Business’ led by the Ministry of Science, ICT &Future Planning. With the support of a government expenditure of about a billion won, CBNU plans to establish the Department of Quantum System Engineering and Plasma Application Engineering to raise professional manpower. In addition, it is constructing the nation’s first and world’s fifth supersonic high-temperature plasma producer, which will be operated starting next year. Plasma, which is being called ‘the forth state’ because it is not solid, liquid, or gas but rather ionized, is currently being commercialized in various areas such as ultra-thin monitors, non-cooling rocket engines, and artificial sunlight. In 2009, CBNU was selected in the business of construction of an application research center, a large national project. In 2011, 40 billion won was invested in the application center, which is making progress.
