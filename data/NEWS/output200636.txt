 July 18th to 19th, a startup camp located at Hanok village for CBNU students(learning about venture business and starting up a new company) was held by the Industrial Cooperation Foundation, LINC business center and Jeonju City. There were about 30 participant swho experienced this program last year and who are now interested in starting their own company. At these camps, students looked around the Hanok village while they were completing the mission of thinking of their own business items in order to improve their entrepreneurship. CBNU is expecting this camp to work as a base for student start-ups, and is also expecting them to continue the startups. Kwon Dae-kyu, the headmaster of the Startup Education Center, said, “Through this camp, students would have an opportunity to understand what social enterprise really is and to broaden their vision.”
