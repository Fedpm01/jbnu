 held a hanok architecture experience camp on July 29th. CBNU has been selected as the best education institution in the business of training experts for designing hanoks for three years in a row by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs. Furthermore, CBNU is doing hanok education and Korean-style campus construction in order to make it the most Korean university. Last year, CBNU and Jeonju signed an agreement on the Hanok construction agreement. In addition, CBNU and Korea Institute of Registered Architects agreed to have an MOU(memorandum of understanding). The chief of the Hanok Building Technique Center of CBNU said, "My first reaction was surprise rather than worry. This camp was widely accepted by high school students that participated last year. We will seek more substance for helping student education."
