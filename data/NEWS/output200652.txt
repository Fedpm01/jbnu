em Shabir, an Indian foreign student in a doctoral course in CBNU Veterinary Medicine, has developed a vaccine which can prevent the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS). PRRS is a fatal disease that affects swine. The study was presented at the Korean Society of Veterinary Science Academic Conference and awarded the Superior Presentation Winner. Nadeem Shabir produced a mixture of virus by reorganizing two pigsâ€™ viruses that had different genes. He also found that the recombinant virus effectively prevented the infection of two pig viruses. The study is anticipated to lead the wide defense and immunity against the PRRS virus. It is also expected to reduce loss in the domestic pig industry.
