Regional Barley and Wheat Genetic Resource Center and National Academy of Agricultural Science have published a book named ‘Genetic Resource Characteristic of Korean Native Wheat’. The book compiling the history and features of Korean native wheat is expected to contribute significantly to the conservation of Korean native wheat. In particular, this book contains 373 kinds of native wheat, including those that have grown in Korea for such a long time, with the specific description of characteristics and pictures. “This book makes us realize that native wheat is an important resource by showing how ancestors ended hunger with native wheat,” the chief of Regional Barley and Wheat Genetic Resource Center, Yun Song-joong, said.
