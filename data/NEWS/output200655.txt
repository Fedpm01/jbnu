essor Lee Dong-won in the department of BIN Fusion Technology has developed a pro-drug for curing cancer by using aldehydes material from cinnamon. The research paper of Professor Lee was published in ‘Advanced Functional Materials’, which has worldwide prestige regarding materials. Cinnamic aldehyde, which is famous for being good at curing cancer, has a lot of problems because of its fast emission from the body. However, Professor Lee succeeded in developing cinnamon aldehyde into an effective anti-cancer drug. In particular, Lee said, "By using this pro-drug with already existing medicine, it will make a good synergic effect." aFor now, this research is used to treat and diagnose cancer as made by the anticancer drug. In the near future, the material would be used for chemotherapy.
