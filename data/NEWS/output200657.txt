Book and Information Center (BIC) was completed its construction and is expected to open in March 2014. Before it opens, CBNU plans to make the BIC have high tech equipment. To achieve it, since October, CBNU gathered the BIC development fund. Surprisingly, there were almost 100 donors and a donation of 100 million won was gathered in less than a month. In particular, Professor Kim Suhn-hee and Eun Jong-pil of the CBNU Medical School donated all funds from their prize to the BIC development fund. Added to this, CBNU decided to extend the scope of donation of BIC development from not only to people at CBNU but also to alumni and the general public. Then it will use all funds to make the BIC the best center of knowledge and information.
