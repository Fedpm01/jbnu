rnational students from the Philippines and Korean students have started a fund-raising campaign for helping the Philippines. Recently, the Philippines was devastated by a super typhoon named Haiyan. The head of international students from the Philippines, named Inero V. Ancho, suggested the CBNU International Affairs Office to aid the Philippines through the university. Therefore, they started a fund-raising campaign with the active support of CBNU, and the campaign is conducted every day around the old main entrance of CBNU. The students not only deliver the monetary donation but also provide some clothes needed for victims of natural disasters through the Red Cross. The CBNU head office also participated in the campaign in the way of account deposits. “I hope our efforts from CBNU can be helpful to the victims in the Philippines,” a director from the Office of International Cooperation & Education, Kim Min-ho, said.
