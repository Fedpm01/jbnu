 students in the Department of Korean Music had a concert in the Hanok village on November 7th. For this performance, the students and the graduates prepared together from plan to performance. While showing the skills that they had mastered on the stage, students promised to achieve the future vision. Thus, they chose the theme of this concert as ‘Neul-peum’, which means the possibility for advancement. 30 students participated in the concert, where they played pansori, instrumental music, and percussion. They also mixed Korean classical music with Western music through playing the folk song transcribed for a cappella and piano.
