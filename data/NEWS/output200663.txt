CBNU students of GTEP (Global Trade Experts Incubating Program) have now won the grand prize in the Seminar of Trade Remedy by the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy and the Korean Trade Association in Seoul three years in a row. The competition is a formation of a remedy or solution for unfair trade. They led with high scores from the judges while giving a problem and solution about the patent dispute process. "CBNU students' capability is a great pride nationwide because there is no university that received the grand prize three years in a row. Also, this will really help students in employment," Honorary Professor Yoon Choong-won in the Department of International Trade, who has prepared annually this contest, said.
