l now, when CBNU has held employment and career consultation for students who were interested in employment, it has been limited to some students. However, the consultation will now be expanded to every student. The CBNU Career Support Center holds 'visiting consultation day' and visits each college more than once a week. In addition, it provides juniors information about employment, interview skills and so on. Therefore, it is expected to cause a positive effect for early career set-up and improvement of employment rate. Shim Gab-yong, the chief of the Career Support Center, said, "Consultation about career and employment is the basis of employment support. I hope professional counselors will scratch studentsâ€™ itches."
