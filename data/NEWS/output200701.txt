Cheol-ro, a professor in the Department of Information Materials Engineering, recently attracted academic attention for developing new technology which can produce hyperfine nanoscale 'Single Nanowire LED' by using nanowire that has higher quality than existing semiconductor material. This technology is expected to be utilized in various fields, because it is original technology for producing a new concept of nanoscale semiconductor. It is made by conflating nanoscale electric devices with nanoscale LED optoelectronic devices. In particular, it is adapted to make NOMS (Nanoscale Optoelectronic Mechanical System). The research is for realization of a next-generation ‘nanoscale electronic-optoelectronic semiconductor device’. It is made by combining nanoscale silicon semiconductors having good electromagnetic and electronic properties with nanoscale nitride semiconductors possessing fine optoelectronic properties. This research is achieved with support from the National Research Foundation of Korea and the participation of Ra Yong-ho and Park Ji-hyeon of the doctoral program.
