 has been selected by the government as a main educating institution of the timber industry and wood circulation system to companies in Honam and Chungchung province. The government has announced the law on ‘Consistent Use of Timber’ since last year and it is mandatory for all registered companies to have professional knowledge about wood construction and its delivery system. This education started on March 3rd, and it is scheduled for 35 hours for 150 wood manufacturing companies. CBNU will help students who are interested in the timber industry with their careers. Through this, CBNU will try to have contracts with the companies that are participating to give students field practice for their development. Professor Park Hee-jun in the Department of Human Ecology said, “The timber industry has been in a slump for a while. However, this entrustment will help to get over this situation.”
