NU has been assessed as the best university in the field of oil refining and petro chemistry. The Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Korean Council for University Education (KCUE) announced this result on May 14atha. CBNU was considered as a competent university by the heads and employees of about 390 enterprises such as LG, SK innovation, and S-OIL. In particular, the school’s practical curriculum was highly acclaimed because CBNU helped students possess not only knowledge but also virtue. CBNU students can manage their experiences through the ‘Grand Person Project’. Consequently, the project received a favorable review. Moreover, CBNU has job competency programs and global leader programs such as its capstone design program and exchange student program. These programs are operated more actively than at any other universities around the country. The MOE and KCUE are going to distribute the entire analysis about this assessment to all universities, where it will be used for improving educational material.a
