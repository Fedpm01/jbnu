team of Lee Yong-cheol, a professor in the Medical School, has suggested the possibility of development of a new medicine for severe asthma. The team said, “The stress of the endoplasmic reticulum exists in a patient’s body more than in normal people. When this stress is controlled, the effect appears in animal models.” They investigated a relation between controlling the stress of the endoplasmic reticulum and developing the medicine for asthma. Moreover, this discovery has an importance to science and a clinical value. In association with this solution, the team has announced a steroid which resists severe asthma. The study was published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and selected as the best thesis of the nation by the Biological Research Information Center. This new research is expected to be a new solution for curing severe asthma.
