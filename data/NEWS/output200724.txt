 has set out to support start-ups. CBNU has strengthened internal stability through managing start-up clubs. Recently, CBNU clarified enforcement of the project '2014 Dream Wing' for supporting student start-ups. CBNU will carry out the plan by dividing it into stage one and two to seek out more excellent start-up clubs. First, at stage one, 25 of the JB-IS (Jeonbuk Incubating System) start-up clubs will receive basic start-up classes, and they will join a mentoring program. At stage two, prize winners of the 'JB-IS Dream Wing Contest' will be supported with various aids such as development expenses and training for actual start-up. The chief of the start-up education center, Kwon Dae-gyu, said, “I will try to discover talents who are really competent to establish a business. Also, I will do my best to get the creative thoughts of students about start-up.”
