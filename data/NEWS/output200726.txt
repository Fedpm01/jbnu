 recently ranked high in the '2014 Evaluation of Asian Universities' by QS, a global university accreditation system in England, and Chosunilbo. CBNU has gone up from its previous rank of 97th to 87th in Asia. This evaluation considers research ability, education level, alumni reputation and internationalization. CBNU has encouraged professors to write more of their theses. It has expanded its systematic professor evaluation system and incentive since the end of 2006. For these reasons, CBNU professors can write high-quality papers which are quoted by professors in another university. Also, by sending more than 1,000 students abroad, CBNU has a great reputation as a global school. CBNU President Suh Geo-suk said, "The reason why CBNU achieves good results in the university appraisal is CBNU members’ effort to increase competitiveness. CBNU　sets a goal of being a university which represents South Korea by keeping change and innovation."
