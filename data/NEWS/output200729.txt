 museum will provide diverse and creative educational activities to young people with well-grounded education infrastructure. For this, the museum and the Jeonju Office of Education has made an agreement for vitalization of education based on experience and has promised intimate exchange. According to this agreement, the museum is going to provide places and teachers to carry out experiential programs and many other sorts of educational programs for youth. Also, the Jeonju Office of Education is to establish the foundation of educational activities and improve the quality of education by supporting young students to visit and experience the Museum. In particular, because the office is co-running an experiential program, 'Museum, Humanities on the Street', it is expected that this agreement will have a positive effect on the experiential study of young students.
