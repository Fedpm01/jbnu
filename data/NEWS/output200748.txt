CBNU students, Son Dae-beom (Department of Molecular Biology) and Oh Yeon-jeong (Department of Business Administration) recently won an award of excellence at an exhibition of ideas held by Shinhan Bank. They submitted an idea which is attainable in real life and offers a detailed way to prepare for risk in interest rates. The exhibition host evaluated that their idea was a very good solution to help problems of low fertility, tuition, and employment. The idea was also complimented in that it could become a good countermeasure to secure long-term clients. “Our idea is not just a finance-focused product,” Son Dae-beom said. “We also try to develop a product which matches with the life cycle of a person. We hope that our product can become a good solution for principal financial difficulties.”
