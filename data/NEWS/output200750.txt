 Je-yoon, the chairman of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), had a meeting about the business start-up on August 28th at the CBNU library. The meeting was managed with the chairmen of 12 companies as well as CBNU President Suh Geo-suk, concerned officials of CBNU and students related to business start-ups. One of the students studying archaeology and & cultural anthropology said, "In order to start a business, many students have no choice but to borrow money at finance companies because we cannot borrow from the banks, which have lower interest rates." Also, he added, "I hope that financial system supports students preparing for business start-ups.” aIn response to the student’s request, Shin answered to promise to make up for the system. Moreover, Shin looked around the CBNU Business Incubator Center and said, "The solid base of business start-up is the reason why the Finnish Economy didn't get demolished, and I would improve the system to minimize business failure."
