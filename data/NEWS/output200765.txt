 Professor Shin Hyo-keun in the School of Dentistry received the commendation from the president through the 2014 national recommendation prize. The prize has a valuable meaning to thank him for his sharing with underprivileged people around us. Professor Shin, who is called the “living Schweitzer,” has visited Vietnam and has had surgery for patients who have cleft lips and palates for free since 1995. The number of patients who were operated on by Professor Shin reached almost 600 people. Professor Shin had already won two medals from the Vietnamnese government through getting credit for operating on patients. “I am so glad to see their smiles. I’ll try to help the patients with cleft lips and palates as long as I can,” Shin said.
