 and the University of Dhaka, which is the best university in Bangladesh, recently pledged cooperation in many different fields. A professor of anthropology at the University of Dhaka, Dr. Saifur Rashid, visited our university to attend an international seminar hosted by the BK21PLUS Center on January 15th. Rashid met with Hahm Han-hee, who is the head of the department of Archaeological & Cultural Anthropology at the BK21PLUS center, and made the MOU agreement. Through this agreement, CBNU can exchange students, academic materials, and information with the University of Dhaka. In particular, it will be a great opportunity to fulfill the main agenda of this center, which is “Culture ODA (Official Development Assistance).” Hahm said, "The recent MOU agreement with the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh is a task of great significance to our business."
