group “Cultivating Competent People for New Korean Wave” was selected as a characteristic business last year to hold a Korean cultural festival in America. This event was prepared by students from eight departments: the Library and Information Science, History, French, Architectural Engineering, Software Engineering, Statistics, Korean Music, and Industrial Design. It was held from January 28th to 30th in Atlanta, including Georgia State University. In the festival, a documentary about the Jeonju Hanok Village and a short film were shown, and various performances were provided. Moreover, there were many experiential events such as traditional plays, and the photography section received a great response. The head of the group, Kim Geon, said, “This event is the first festival held and prepared by students in another country.” He added, “By making a festival themselves, students from diverse majors will learn fusion education and enhance global competence and creativity.”
