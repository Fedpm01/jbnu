 held a children’s hanok camp for 30 elementary students who live in Gochang on December 26th, 2014. This camp provided children with the chance to experience traditional structure. The camp was held by Gochang local governments and CBNU’s Gochang campus for the local community. The camp educated on the beauty and science of hanoks. The camp also gave children experience with sawing, drawing a line with Korean ink, and assembling hanok models and ondol (a Korean floor heating system which represents the science of hanok). In particular, children consulted with Professor Nam Hae-kyeong (Department of Architectural Engineering) and his students in the graduate school about life and careers. Professor Nam said, “CBNU will make an effort to hold more events involving local community.”
