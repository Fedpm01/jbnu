 students in the Department of Child Studies have been making a talent donation to child patients in Chonbuk National University Hospital (CUH) since last September. Six students have volunteered every Wednesday and Friday. On Wednesdays, they work as assistants in the physical programs and on Fridays, they provide the programs designed by the students themselves. They also carry out mentoring programs about learning. Jin Sun-jin, who participated as a volunteer, said, “I’m deeply impressed by the children who became more independent than before. I could get so much positive energy from the bright children.” Moreover, the students performed a special concert for children last Christmas. They performed a magic show and musical, played ukulele, and held a puppet show and black-light performance.
