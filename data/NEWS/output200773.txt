essor Lee Dong-won in the Department of BIN Convergence Technology recently developed a new high molecular medicine. The medicine eliminates harmful active oxygen. It also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Lee developed new medicine to solve the problem existing medicine has: low solubility into the body and fast discharge from the body. Therefore, he conducted the research about inventing high molecular medicine, which was made in nanoscale. Through this development, he published papers in eminent journals such as Nature Materials, Advanced Functional Materials, and Biomaterials. This medicine will be available commercially after passing all clinical trials. The professor is transferring technology with Celdara Medical, which is a bio company in America.
