 held a leadership camp from January 26th to 27th. The leadership camp was given to the enrolled students who were entered by an admissions officer system. This camp was very well-received by students. At the leadership camp, the admissions officers and the members of the Carnegie Human Resource Development Center provided students with programs such as setting up their visions, building self-confidence, managing human relations, communicating sensibly, and acknowledging the power of compliments. Lee Nam-ho, the president of CBNU, said that this camp made the students have self-confidence and helped them to observe their conditions in a different way.
