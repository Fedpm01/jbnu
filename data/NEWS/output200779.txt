 has started to collaborate with the Rural Development Administration (RDA), National Institute of Animal Science (NIAS), and Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (QIA). They held a seminar for preventing animal disease on January 29th. In the seminar, they decided to proceed with joint research on development of the livestock industry and prevention of animal disease. They discussed technology that could manage useful microorganisms for preventing animal diseases and planned for joint research on animal disease and disinfection management. From this collaboration, it is expected that CBNU will become a center for disinfecting animal disease.
