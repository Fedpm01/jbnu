essor Lee Dong-won's research team in the Department of BIN Convergence Technology has attracted world-wide attention by developing a new anticancer medicine. This research result was posted on the April 20th online edition of Nature Communication. It is called a “dual stimuli-responsive hybrid anticancer drug.” It kills only cancer cells. It reduces anti-oxidant systems of cancer cells, being activated by slight acid which is in the unique environment of cancer cells and has a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide. At the same time, it generates reactive oxygen species and makes cancer cells kill themselves by inducing oxidative stress.
