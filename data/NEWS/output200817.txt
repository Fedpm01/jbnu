 President Lee Nam-ho has implemented the “meeting day with the president” since April 2015 to hear the opinion of CBNU members. President Lee opened a communication- and welfare-related homepage. Every CBNU member can talk with the CBNU president one-on-one after they decide the meeting date and time. President Lee said, "To be beyond maturity, communication with CBNU members is necessary and the system was made for this reason. I will meet lots of members, from professors or employees to students, and try to reflect on their thinking and opinions"
