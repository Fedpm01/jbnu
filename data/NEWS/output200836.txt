 was selected as a 2015 Lifelong Learning Center College. The Lifelong Learning Center College is an education system in which high-school graduate employees can do their learning and work. Also, adult learners can be supported on a lifetime cycle through customized learning. Our college was selected in the categories of “degree and non-degree” and “specialty and scarcity field representative college.” Through this, CBNU is supported with about 500 million won from the government. As a degree course, our college will establish an incumbent person for the special admission department and the adolescent and lifelong learning department for registering in the part-time course in the Department of Software Engineering and the Department of Forest Environmental Science. CBNU President Lee Nam-ho said, “To widen the opportunity for adult learners’ education is local colleges’ duty. Also, I will support lots of people to keep going in learning their passion.”
