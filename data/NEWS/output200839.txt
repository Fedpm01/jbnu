 was selected as the best university which contributes to normalizing high school education by the Ministry of Education (MOE). In particular, CBNU received high praise for the highschool- and university-connected program and free semester-supporting program. Since 2008, after introducing the Admissions Officer System, CBNU has been supported by the government. CBNU has tried to develop various admission methods which reflect each group’s character and these have been praised for fairness, reliability, and professionalism. Choi Young-jun, the chief of the Office of Admissions, said, “This achievement means that CBNU always strives not only for keeping stability and development of admission but also for normalizing public education. CBNU is very proud of the achievement and I will continue to advance admissions methods.”
