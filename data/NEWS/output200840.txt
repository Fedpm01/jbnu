ntly, Professor Seo Pil-joon in the Department of Chemistry has attracted the attention of researchers through investigating how plants bloom in response to temperature change. Professor Seo and his team conducted research on the atmospheric temperature sensing mechanism of plants and the result was published in scientific reports. The study revealed that while finely controlling the flowering time of plants depending on the outside air temperature, enzymes “(E3 ligase) COP1” lead the gene ”GIGANTEA: GI” to resolve proteins. Professor Seo said, "If global climate change becomes even more serious, the study can contribute to the development of crops that respond better to external environmental conditions.”
