ntly, the “e+ Festival” was held at Jinsudang on the CBNU campus. This festival was hosted by LINC (Leader Industry University Cooperation) and gave a chance for CBNU students to experience a creative engineering design called Capstone Design. In this festival, students’ works through the Capstone Design Project were exhibited. LINC gave awards to the best teams that had a chance to transfer their idea through “Open Market.” Through this festival, companies could get students’ creative ideas and students also could have a chance to enhance their abilities to solve practical problems. The chief of LINC, Seol Gyeong-won, said, “The e+ festival is an open door for students to not only have a chance to display their ideas and but also to industrialize them. I will try to realize more student’s ideas through close interaction and cooperation with companies.”
