“Find Dream Team” consisting of CBNU students recently won the fourth Prudential Good Project. This project introduces the set subject to society effectively and carries out their plan. This year’s subject was “dispersion of hematopoietic stem cell donation.” Leukemia patients can’t produce healthy blood. Therefore, they should be treated through stem cell transplantation. However, many people are reluctant to donate because of prejudice against donation. For this reason, this contest evaluated student’s unique ideas for dispersion of hematopoietic stem cell donation. The CBNU team went out on the street to conduct a campaign and registered list for stem cell transplantation. They also made a movie about a patient who needs stem cell transplantation.
