 recently held a festival for international students studying in Jeollabuk-do. The international students held a traditional costume parade, shared food from each country, and played traditional games. This program became a field of communication for the students. In particular, this program has received good reviews from the international students, enough to make an impression of “Jeollabuk-do, the place to study abroad.” The student leader of the Department of English Language & Literature, Lee Yong-hak, who planned this festival, said, "I hope that the international students introduce the excellence of Korea and Jeollabuk-do to their own countries. Moreover, I wish to raise the status of our local university through this festival."
