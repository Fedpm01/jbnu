 LINC (Leaders in Industry University Cooperation) will support its family company to open up to overseas market. LINC is planning to support six companies to participate in foreign exhibitions. Students promoted family company products, developed a marketing strategy, produced PR materials, and sold them. With support from LINC, family companies could open up to overseas markets, and students could learn the practice of trading. Professor Seol Kyoung-won, the headmaster of LINC, said, "We will make more opportunities to push into the world market in cooperation with family companies. Moreover, we will expand supported businesses to enhance students' global business ability."
