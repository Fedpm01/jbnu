 LINC (Leaders in Industry University Cooperation) has striven for corporations to improve their image and to launch new products. As a part of this business, on September 16th, CBNU held the “Students Competition for Corporation Image (CI) & Business Intelligence (BI) Producing Support”, with nine corporations. The purpose of this competition was not only promoting interaction between university and corporations but also putting various ideas of university students to practical use. Furthermore, this business has offered mentoring programs with corporations to students, and any students who had creative ideas could apply for this business. Seol Kyeong-won, the chief of this business, said, “To achieve a creative economy, it is essential for corporations and students to go together. Besides, other overseas marketing supporting businesses of LINC can be helpful for many corporations.”
