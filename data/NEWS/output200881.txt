 GTEP (Glocal Trade Experts Incubating Program) is supporting small and medium enterprises’ export activities and overseas interns to incubate students as trade experts. According to GTEP, students under GTEP are leading Jeonbuk province’s small and medium enterprises’ export activities. Also, annually, ten to fifteen students are in charge of trade work in foreign small and medium enterprises for three months, increasing their trade abilities. Last semester, four students completed the trade intern process. Also, in this winter vacation, four students will be sent to Shanghai, China, or to other places to perform the trade intern process. Professor Yoon Chung-weon, who is in charge of GTEP’s overseas interns, said “The GTEP intern process is essential to incubate students’ trade expertise. Also, it helps student’s employment and becomes an unforgettable experience.”
