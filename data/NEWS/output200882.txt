CBNU Female Student Career Development Center in the Office of Career Support is leading the female students’ careers through a mentoring program. In October, they held a trio mentoring program with female students of Chonbuk National University High School and CBNU’s female students and professors. This program was held for the third time this year to help the female high school students to establish a specific goal for their careers by being mentored. Annually, through this program, CBNU female students found their potential and developed self-improvement by learning careers and self-leadership from professors. Also, female high school students got advice from senior CBNU students regarding career decisions. The chief of the Female Student Career Development Center said “There are limitations of career selection and development to women in Korea. Therefore, I’m expecting that this mentoring program will contribute to women’s career guidance.”
