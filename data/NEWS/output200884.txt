 harvested from the CBNU vegetable garden which was parceled out to the local residents earlier this year. CBNU shared saplings for free and educated on basic farming practices for them. Recently, CBNU had a harvest event with CBNU major authorities and families who participated in this garden. People harvested the farm products that they had produced. Moreover, CBNU presented rice produced by the College of Agriculture & Life Science to the excellent participants. The local residents had a meaningful time to communicate with CBNU members through the CBNU garden. CBNU President Lee Nam-ho said, "The CBNU vegetable garden is important to keep in tune and communicate with the local residents by providing campus wilderness. I hope that many students can dream and be proud of CBNU through this vegetable garden."
