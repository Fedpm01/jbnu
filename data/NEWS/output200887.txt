rinarian Kim Hyeong-nyeon, who graduated from the CBNU College of Veterinary Medicine, has endowed scholarships every year since 2003. The total amount of the scholarship is almost 300 million won, and it is called the Kim Hyeong-nyeon Scholarship. He has encouraged students who strive hard to make their dreams come true, in spite of poor conditions. According to Dr. Kim, “It feels really great to fulfill my goal. Furthermore, I hope that lots of students will bring honor to CBNU and also lead to regional and national development.” CBNU created a classroom on the Iksan campus called “Kim Hyeong-nyeon Hall” in order to praise his endowment. CBNU President Lee Nam-ho said, “I really thank him for his contribution and will do my best to make CBNU incubate adventurous students.”
