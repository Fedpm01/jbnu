 has been selected as a training institution for ASEAN students of Science and Engineering for two years in a row, a selection that the National Institute for International Education (NIIED) of the Ministry of Education supports as national project. This project was enforced since last year to lead the ASEAN students of Science and Engineering to enter domestic graduate schools by supporting training courses in domestic universities. In the 2016 summer vacation, students will take the training course for six weeks. During this period, the Office of International Cooperation and the Department of Electronic Engineering will establish a consortium with laboratory and industry nurturing ASEAN students of Science and Engineering in the IT field. In particular, CBNU will provide students with various education programs such as telecommunication engineering classes and Korean education.â€ƒ
