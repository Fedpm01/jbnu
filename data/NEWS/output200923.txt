ane University in Japan recently visited CBNU to benchmark an honorary ambassador system. They listened to explanations about all the management of CBNU honorary ambassadors. They benchmarked our process of selection, major activities, and uniforms in detail by meeting CBNU honorary ambassadors directly. In particular, they were impressed by the 'Feeling Korea' program at CBNU, so they introduced a 'Summer School' program which is operated during vacation. CBNU President Lee Nam-ho said, "We carried out a student exchange program and academic exchange well, so other universities envy us. If we strengthen the strength and make up for the weakness of the honorary ambassador system of both universities through this meeting, it will be effective to publicize each university."
