ntly, CBNU President Lee Nam-ho walked with students in the Residential College and professors through Dulle-gil. The goal of walking Dulle-gil is to give opportunities to students for communicating freely with friends and colleagues. In particular, using the campus Dulle-gil as a non-subject area of student education, CBNU will start its “Exploration Certification System,” reflecting credits in “Adventure & Creative Thinking” when they complete the 11.4 kilometer course, in the middle of this month. From this, CBNU will help students to get an attitude of communication and harmony and to think creatively by having their own meditation and healing time. President Lee Nam-ho said, “’Philosopher's Road’ in the University of Heidelberg in Germany is a place where contemporary philosophers such as Goethe, Hegel and Heidegger made great discoveries and formulated their theories through meditation. Likewise, I expect students to come up with lots of creative ideas that change the world on CBNU’s Dulle-gil.”
