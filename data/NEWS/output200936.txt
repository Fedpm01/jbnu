 Hyun-yub, a CBNU student from the Division of Business Administration, participated in the 2016 Hong Kong Gifts & Premium Fair with his peer, Lee Min-seong. The CBNU Glocal Trade Experts Incubating Program (GTEP) supported them. They took the responsibility to spread word to the overseas buyers about cooperative enterprise and I-MASTI products and develop a way to export. In this day, they underwent 17 cases of consultation, which is 220,000 dollars’ worth. They accomplished the contracts that will actually lead to exporting 220,000 dollars. Moon Hyun-yub said, “While I participated in most of the business with initiative, I felt that the reality was different from what I had learned through books and lectures. I felt trading to be more attractive through the fact that our efforts could lead to the growth of a corporation.”
