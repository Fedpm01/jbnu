essor Cho Eui-sic in the School of Dentistry and his team investigatedathe core signal transmission route which regulates the formation of the periodontal tissue. The team compared a normal rat with a rat blocking the “TGF-beta (Transforming Growth Factor-beta)” which causes a disease. They found the latter didn’t form cements, which were essential tissues for attaching teeth to the jawbone. Moreover, TGF-beta is working through Osterix, which controls cell differentiation in the formation process of a tooth root. Through this discovery, the result that gum disease will be prevented was published in Scientific Reports, which is a global journal. Professor Cho said, “Reproduction of the damaged periodontal tissue is the most important thing and we will contribute to developing a new treatment for periodontal disease effectively”.
