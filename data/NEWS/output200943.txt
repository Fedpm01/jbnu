five years starting from 2011, the CBNU LED Fusion Technology Center (LAFTRC), which has been working on the project “Industrialization and Development of LED Agri-Bio Fusion Technology” funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), achieved excellent results such as constructing an LED plant factory test bed in aaforeign country. Due to the business, the Jeonbuk Branch of the Korea Institute of Lighting Technology was opened and is expected to be a great help to Jeonbuk enterprises in the industrialization of LED Agri-Bioscience. To prove the excellence of the LED Agri-Bioscience research, CBNU published about twenty SCI-level theses and registered 29 patents and also presented more than 185 cases in conferences. In particular, LAFTRC supported technology to developing countries and transferred technology through R&D. The director of LAFTRC, Hong Chang-hee, said, “By using the remaining infrastructure, I will try to bring new and high valued results to the Agri-Bioscience field.”
