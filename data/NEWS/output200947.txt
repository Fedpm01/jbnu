 President Lee Nam-ho recently lectured to students about adventure, emphasizing becoming adventurousastudents beyond model students. Additionally, he explained various communicative ways, chasing vision, performance, the status of CBNU, and so on. In particular, President Lee Nam-ho suggested the type of personal brand that CBNU will bring up through the slogan, “University Raising Adventurous Students beyond Model Students.” He also explained “Residential College” and “Off Campus” concepts that will actualize the slogan. He emphasized that the premise of the university’s development is communication. For example, “Saturday Date,” “Walk Talk Day” and the Jeonbuk Hyundai supporters group are good ways to communicate not only with CBNU members but also with the regional community. Lastly, he said, “Our life is always filled with risks. However, the most dangerous thing is settling for the present. Don't be just a ship in port. Become a ship on the rough sea."
