NU announced the progress of “The Fourth Odysseus Project” on July 15th. This project was made to find talented high school students in engineering. For one year, 11 professors from the engineering field became mentors for 50 high school students to help them do research activities. This encouraged high school students to enter the engineering field, which helps find the talented people needed in the society. The significance of this project is that the students go to the laboratory periodically and do research at real workplaces. The students also get a chance to go to Oxford University and European companies to help build their future visions. The head of the Education Center for Creative Future Engineers, Kim Dong-won, said, “It is difficult to plan their future as engineers only with this project, but I hope they learn to challenge themselves by seeing the hardworking predecessors.” a
