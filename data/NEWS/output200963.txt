NU sends about 200 students to foreign universities through the “Off Campus” program. CBNU introduced this program to raise adventurous students, beyond model students. Students will stay overseas or in specific regions for at least one semester and learn not only foreign languages but also local cultures. Students will also participate in varied programs such as volunteer work, internships, visiting local enterprises, and taking special lectures from local personages. The Executive Vice President of External Cooperation, Yang Moon-sik, said, "Off Campus is CBNU's only program for training global talent. Any student can stay overseas for at least one semester and learn local cultures. I hope students grow to become creative talents to lead the future through this program."a
