Jeonbuk International Development Cooperation Center (IDCC) has moved from its temporary office to the New Silk Road Center. To vitalize the participation of local areas toward ODA(Official Development Assistance)business and the internationalization of Jeonbuk, the IDCC makes an effort to hold business information sessions for investors of ODA and for global citizenship education. The IDCC and CK-1 International Development Cooperation also made a cooperative agreement about ODA business. President Lee Nam-ho said, “Recently, CBNU is in process of cooperation by giving aid in the form of New Renewable Energy Organic Farming Technology in Nepal, and in the form of poultry farming fields in Bangladesh, while teaching how they use the technologies.” Lee Wook-heon, who is the head of the IDCC said, “With continuous activities, we will make an effort to make Jeonbuk into an ODA-leading area.”
