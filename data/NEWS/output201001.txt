ntly, CBNU students in the College of Engineering won a prize in the Advancement for College Education Forum (ACE Forum), which is supported by the Ministry of Education (MOE). In this forum, universities which are selected as ACE share their college education business cases and are selected for the best education models. In particular, CBNU has conducted a “3-Step Master Program,” which encourages students’ employment and nurtures the professional ability of a leader. Yoo Cheol-jung, the head of the program, said, “I am proud of the prizes and I will try to nurture practical veterans of business with this program. CBNU will consistently focus on students’ professional ability rather than just curriculum.”
