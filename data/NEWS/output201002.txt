CBNU will work together with the DGMIF in the fields of new medicine, medical devices, and clinical tests. DGMIF and CBNU will share research facilities together through the agreement.

CBNU President Lee Nam-ho said, “The agreement will have a new impact on developing the medical industry. I hope that we can get satisfactory results in terms of nurturing talents to lead the high-tech medical industry and producing new drugs.”
