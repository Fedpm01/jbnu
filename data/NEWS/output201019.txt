 recently made an agreement with Ulster University in the United Kingdom. CBNU is the only university in Korea which cooperates with Ulster University. CBNU will lead this agreement to a win-win situation for each university. In particular, CBNU would exchange staff members and professors as well as undergraduates with Ulster University. Furthermore, CBNU undergraduates can have more opportunities to study in and to experience the United Kingdom. With this agreement, each university will share scholarly monographs and publications. CBNU President Lee Nam-ho said, “Thanks to this agreement, CBNU undergraduates have more opportunities that demonstrate their abilities and study abroad. I hope that CBNU students will be competent adventurers.”
