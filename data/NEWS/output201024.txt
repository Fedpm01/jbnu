 has grown for 70 years and is going toward the maturity of 100 years. CBNU has released a new UI(University Identity) and catchphrase welcoming 70 years of CBNU. There are two types of the UI, a traditional one and a modern one. The making of the modern UI started in 2015, and, after 35 drafts, the final UI was chosen last November. The UI shows several meanings: CBNU at the summit, balance and harmony, challenge and adventure, learning, respect towards people and nature, maturity, and the being the most Korean university. The two UIs will be used as a dual system according to their uses. Last year, CBNU held a domestic contest for a new emblem and catchphrase celebrating the 70th anniversary. A total of 70 emblems and 624 catchphrases were submitted. The winning emblem showed a sea and sun, which shows an emerging and dynamic CBNU. The catchphrase shows the growth of 70 years and the future for maturity in 100 years.
