 held a 70th anniversary donation campaign to make itself the most Korean-style campus. The 70th anniversary donation campaign is similar to the 1004 relay donation campaign held in 2015. However the 70th anniversary donation campaign is a relay-type donation to build hanok-style buildings starting from the main gate to the 70th anniversary memorial plaza. Contributors will get their names imprinted on the future buildings. CBNU president Lee Nam-ho said, “Even though we were supported by the government for the 70th anniversary project, this project cannot go well without the help of the local residents and the alumni. I hope the local residents and alumni take more interest in the project to make CBNU a more Korean-style campus.”
