CBNU initiative College of Humanities’ Research and Education (CORE) and the Institute for the Study of France & Africa will collaborate with universities and corporations in Morocco. Recently, they visited Morocco and agreed to cooperate with the Institute for the Study of Africa in Mohamed V University on administration and exchange. Moreover, CORE will share the management system and experience of the business network and hotel tourism industry in Africa with Morocco’s Kenzi Hotels Group. CBNU students will be able to study and do an internship in Morocco through them. Professor Lee Chong-min, the head of CORE, said, "Francophone Africa is unfamiliar, but there are a lot of marketing opportunities. We will try to give assistance to students by interchanging with them actively."
