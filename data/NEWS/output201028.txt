essor Kim Jae-soo’s team has developed a new insecticidal activity-microorganism ‘Beauveria bassiana ERL836’ and insect pest control system. This research started from 2008 and was introduced to the world journals “Pest Management Science” and “BioControl.” The microorganism ‘ERL836’ will be commercialized to insect pest control systems especially to mulberry thrips. Mulberry thrips is harmful insect which is the medium of a virus and damage from this mulberry thrips is increasing each year.
