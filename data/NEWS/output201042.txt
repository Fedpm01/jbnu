 held an opening ceremony for the Center for Humanities & Social Sciences on March 27th. The building was constructed in accordance with CBNU’s purpose of making the most Korean-style campus. In particular, the Korean-style exteriors such as roof tiles, traditional pattern tiles and conventional timber doors are well exposed. Furthermore, eco-friendly materials such as cypress were used to highlight the interior as more antique and classic. CBNU will construct the Korean-style structures on the basis of this building. CBNU President Lee Nam-ho said, “The opening of the Center for Humanities & Social Sciences is a new challenge and the starting point of CBNU’s convergence study. Please give us a lot of concern and support for making the most Korean-style campus and training adventurous students beyond model students.”
