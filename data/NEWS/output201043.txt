ebruary 2016, CBNU secured a foundation through which the developing countries can participate in development cooperation businesses by establishing an international agricultural development cooperation center. Moreover, CBNU made a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Makerere University which is the best university in Uganda. Through this MOU, students from Makerere University will be trained as agro-livestock experts at CBNU. This can help train labor forces to work in Korea’s agro-livestock fields. Also, this helps expand our livestock industries toward the developing countries by creating developing countries’ customized experts. President Lee Nam-ho said, “High level lectures and organized training education will increase the capability of agro-livestock development cooperation and will help make global leaders that can develop their own country’s agro-livestock industries.”
