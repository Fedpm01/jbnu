ntly, the “Presidential Conversation with Students” was held with 200 people, including President Lee Nam-ho and the student council, as well as the presidents of each college. The event included having time to explain CBNU’s main policies to students and receiving proposals from each college. On this day, students proposed solutions for placement and facilities they use such as club rooms, dormitories, and The New Silk Road Center. President Lee took notes about them, promising to support and invest in them. President Lee said, “I have met students continuously through CBNU’s own communication program like Saturday Date up until now. However, I wanted to pay more attention to students’ stories to apply them to school policy. I will do my best to check what students are having trouble with through amiable face-to-face conversation.”aRecently, the “Presidential Conversation with Students” was held with 200 people, including President Lee Nam-ho and the student council, as well as the presidents of each college.
