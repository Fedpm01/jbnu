essor Hahn Yoon-bong in the Department of Chemical Engineering was awarded the Asian Energy Technology Award from the International Association of Advanced Materials (IAAM). He was recognized for his service in improving nano-composites, which significantly develop the stability of solar cells. In particular, perovskite and organic solar cells, which are remarkable materials of the future, are available for massive production in comparison with silicon ones. However, the problem is that they are difficult to use for a long time due to their weakness in the open air. Thanks to his research, solar cells with developed nano-composite can work better and the lifetime has been dramatically improved. Moreover, the results were patented and the international scientific journal Nano Energy shared his thesis.
