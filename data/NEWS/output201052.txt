 has opened a female-only experimental laboratory in the College of Engineering for fostering talented female engineers. The female-only experimental laboratory ‘WE-FACTORY’ that was named after this program consists of an experimental laboratory, a debate room, and a seminar room. In this place, female engineering students will learn engineering subjects and equipment from industry experts. They also can get student-professor mentoring using the experimental laboratory and seminar room. The Director, Kim Jung-ja, said, “Female professors take the lead to make a female-only experimental laboratory and study space in a relatively male-centered engineering environment culture. It will give power to and inspire female engineering students’ study desire. Through making the WE-FACTORY, CBNU can become the global and local female engineering expert training cradle.”
