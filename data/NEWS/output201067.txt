 student Hwang Guk-hwa, who is doing her PhD at the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy Engineering, presented a research result about interpreting toxic nano-particle qualities in a quantitative way. This research was held with support from the National Institute of Environmental Research and was selected as a cover paper in the top-ranked academic journal “Environmental Science: Nano.” aThe main point of this research is to find measures to deal with toxic nano-substances in the environment. Hwang Guk-hwa said, I could work in a comfortable environment thanks to getting selected by the Global PhD Fellowship and I will study harder to come up with research results to prevent the bad effects of toxic nano-particles in the environment.”
