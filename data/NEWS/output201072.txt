ntly, all CBNU applicants, who are allotted to Jeonbuk, passed the regional officer test. It is a rare case that all allotted students of a university pass the local officer test. This result is actually the second since 2012. Students who passed will work as a probated statement in the Central Administrative Agency for one year and are appointed to be special national officers. aThe Director of the Elite Fostering Center, Park Soo-young, said, “CBNU supports exam materials and promotes students to study with others. Furthermore, students can get useful advice from the past successful applicants, and these have led to good results.” aThe Director of the Elite Fostering Center, Park Soo-young, said, “CBNU supports exam materials and promotes students to study with others.
