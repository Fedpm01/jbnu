archers from the Department of Molecular Biology, the Department of Chemistry, and the Korea Zoonosis Research Institute (KoZRI) will develop useful genetic engineering technology for disease control and establish an organic cooperation system by forming three teams. Professor Kim said, “Three research teams will kill four birds with one stone conducting research on national diseases, developing technology and industrialization, obtaining a status of a global hub center, and training excellent talent.” a  aProfessor Kim Dae-hyuk’s research team in the Department of Molecular Biology received a grant of five billion won from the Ministry of Education and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF). They participate in the research project for prevention and treatment of national diseases such as MERS. The study aims to gain global leadership in national disease control technology based on genetic engineering. aResearchers from the Department of Molecular Biology, the Department of Chemistry, and the Korea Zoonosis Research Institute (KoZRI) will develop useful genetic engineering technology for disease control and establish an organic cooperation system by forming three teams.
