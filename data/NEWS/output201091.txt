Yong-jae, the president of the CBNU alumni association of Seoul donated a large sum of 500 million won to CBNU. He sponsored construction of the tentatively named “Shenzhen Academy” to praise his deceased father. Lee said, “I hope that my deceased father, who devoted his life to CBNU, will be remembered forever in his alma mater." His father, as a professor in the Department of Philosophy, was regarded for his research and achievements on Korean philosophy, culture, and new religions in Korea for the first time since the Japanese colonization. Opening of the Shenzhen Academy will also commemorate the 70th anniversary of CBNU. A traditional school will become a suitable part of the most Korean campus, CBNU.
