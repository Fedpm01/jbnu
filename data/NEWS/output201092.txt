 sends students to universities abroad through the Off Campus program, which support students in learning foreign languages and the culture of the countries. CBNU recently had an opening ceremony for the Off-Campus program at the Paul Hall in Jinsudang. Many students are being dispatched to universities in 15 countries such as the U.S., England, Canada, Australia, the Philippines, and Malaysia this year. Students will be staying overseas for a maximum one year, receiving credits for listening to on-site language classes and basic major classes. Moreover, students are expected to become examples of global talent through having opportunities for homestay, voluntary service, internships, and cultural experiences. President Lee Nam-ho said, “Off-Campus is CBNU’s own program through which any student can study abroad for more than one semester. Through this program, I hope students return as mature and adventurous students.”
