Entrepreneurship Education Center and Leaders in Industry-university Cooperation (LINC) of CBNU are running the 2017 Teenager Imagination Idea Factory (IF) Make-A-thon Program to raise inventive thinking power for the “4th industrial revolution.” This program will raise teenagers’ inventive thinking power through 3D printers and the Internet of Things (IoT) practice. In addition, it will give teenagers self-confidence through idea summary and 1-minute speech contests. This program got a great response in six high schools in Jeollabuk-do in January and was started in Jeonju High School and Wansan High school this July. Kim Man-young, the head of the Entrepreneurship Education Center, said, “Based on the unique entrepreneurial education program system of CBNU, I will go beyond the university and expand to the region to build an entrepreneurial spirit and entrepreneurial culture.”
