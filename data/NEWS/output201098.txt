 Global Trade Experts Incubating Program (GTEP) students achieved export consultation in two recent export shows abroad. The enterprise organization sent two students from the Division of International Trade to the Korea Brand & Entertainment Expo 2017 Taipei (KBEE) and they achieved a 300 million dollar counsel result with the cooperative firm DAINS. Also, two other students sent to Food Taipei 2017 from the Division of International Trade counselled with the Korea Natural Food company. Director Kim Min-ho said, “During the overseas exhibition, we thought it would be a big outcome to just check the market reaction, but we also achieved export contracts at site and this will really help the cooperative firms.” He added, “Above all things, the biggest outcome is that students experienced the export sites in person and were able to demonstrate their ability as much as they could.”
