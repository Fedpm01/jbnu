 recently held its 10th New Korean Wave Festival in Vietnam. In this festival, CBNU students presented various shows about Korean traditional music, K-pop dances, and taekwondo. Moreover, students performed Hanji exhibitions which mixed tradition and modernity. Furthermore, students could enhance their global capabilities by visiting branch offices in Vietnam. According to Kim Geon, Head of the New Korean Wave Festival, “This festival was a good opportunity to promote the superiority of Korean culture in the world. Furthermore, the festival has an important meaning in that CBNU students designed various performances themselves. I promise to support more global programs for students.”
