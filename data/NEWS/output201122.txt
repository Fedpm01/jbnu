team of Professor Kook Sung-ho in the Department of Bioactive Material Science separated the hematopoietic stem cells from the placenta and has been receiving the attention of world academics by revealing their functional characteristics. The results of this study suggested that the research could be used clinically for leukemia patients and cancer patients. The researchers succeeded in isolating hematopoietic stem cells with functional activity using the 'P2Y14 protein' expression in the placenta. In addition, through the experiment of transplanting the isolated hematopoietic stem cells into adult mice, the transplanted stem cells showed multi-lineage differentiation ability and a self-renewal potential capable of forming various blood cells. Further research is active to clarify the role of 'P2Y14 protein' in hematopoietic stem cells derived from the adult mouse bone marrow. This research was carried out with the support of the National Research Foundation of Korea and the research fellow project.
