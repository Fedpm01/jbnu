BNU recently selected “adventurous ambassadors,” consisting of 10 students who have extraordinary experience and excellence in academics, writing, overseas adventure activities, various contests, external volunteer activities, and start-ups. They will share their experiences with other students. Furthermore, they will introduce and spread the news about various adventurous activities through a blog, promotional videos, talk concerts, and consultations. CBNU President Lee Nam-ho said, “The adventurous ambassador system is the first of its kind in 70 years of CBNU history, so I hope for them to be proud of themselves. In addition, I hope every CBNU student becomes a person who is required in the e of the 4th Industrial Revolution, works creatively, and has his or her own ‘story’ and sociability through these adventurous ambassadors.” a
