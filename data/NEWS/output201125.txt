“Most Korean Campus” project, which CBNU is pushing ahead for its 70th anniversary ceremony, is gradually showing its figure. Hammy Yummy, which was designated as in the top five among superior university enterprises, spent its own budget of 690 million won to build a Hanok style shop next to the Old Gate. Hammy Yummy had the ceremony of putting up the ridge beam on September 19th. On the ridge beam in the middle of this building, the best calligrapher in Korea, Professor Kim Byeong-gi of the Department of Chinese Literature, wrote the date and CBNU slogan of “Adventurous Students beyond Model Students!” and “Maturity Moving Beyond Growth.” President Lee Nam-ho said, “Thanks for providing support for CBNU Ham to make a Han-style campus. This building will contribute to promulgating CBNU’s own brand, the ‘Most Korean Campus,’ externally.”
