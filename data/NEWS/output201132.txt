university library is shifting gradually from traditional library where books are emphasized to complex cultural space. In order to show students the beauty of the library, CBNU Library held an exhibition ‘Reading the city and the German library architecture’ by the famous Italian architect Fabio Barilari. Fabio Barilari traveled to various cities in Germany with the support of the Goethe Institute and completed a number of sketches, which gave him a new interpretation of the city and library architecture. This exhibition was held on 13th to 24th of November in the lobby of the CBNU Library and there were 24 kinds of sketches of the libraries and 34 diverse books about the architecture in German.
