 Professor Lee Dong-won in the Department of BIN Fusion Technology developed a 'thrombotic target diagnosis and therapeutic nano drug' that can quickly diagnose and treat blood clots that obstruct the flow of blood in blood vessels. The results of this study were published in the January 2018 issue of ACS Nano, the most authoritative journal in the field of nanoscience. Currently commonly used imaging techniques use radiation energy such as X-rays or CT, although exposure to radiation results in side effects. However, photoacoustic imaging technology uses light without radiation. It has the advantage of realizing high resolution images by combining with ultrasound. The technique attracts attention as a part of next-generation medical imaging technology. Professor Lee said, "Nowadays there is no development of precise imaging diagnosis. This research will lead to actual commercialization."
