“2017 CBNU LINC+ Industry-Academia Collaboration Festival”, where students can meet students' engineering design works in one place, came to a successful end. A Capstone Design Competition, where more than 100 creative design projects were presented based on students' ideas, was held by the LINC+ project team and the Center for Innovation in Engineering Education (At CBNU or in Jeollabuk province?). In addition, the auction market was also held to seek commercial use. The doorbell & IoT (the Internet of Things) device for deaf people, which was presented by the students of the Electronic Engineering College who won the grand prize, received a favorable response from the judges. Many other students from the Department of Aerospace Engineering and the Mechanical Systems Engineering College, who participated in a variety of programs with the support of the LINC + project team, also won different prizes for their unique work.
