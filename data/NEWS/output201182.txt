CBNU CK-1 organization and Specialized Education Program in Advanced Energy Convergence are managing a scholarship program called, “Encouraging Students Project”. This project selects and gives monetary awards to students who did well in only one subject rather than scoring a total score from the previous semester. The purpose of this project is to strengthen confidence in students and motivate them to be self-confident. “Encouraging Students Project” has been implemented since 2014. This year, 114 students were awarded in 38 different subjects. Ahn Byung-Guk, the Head of the Specialized Education Program in Advanced Energy Convergence said, “I wanted to give hope to the students. Despite the current social difficulties in which students have to be proficient in all fields, I wanted to cheer all students up. and I hope these awards will give them confidence, even though they are good at only one particular subject”.
