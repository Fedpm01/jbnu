 turned 85 non-regular workers into regular workers on March 1, 2018. CBNU held an award ceremony for the 85 workers to celebrate the promotion of becoming a regular worker. In this award ceremony, President Lee Nam-ho gave each of them a certificate one by one and encouraged them. So far, CBNU has been producing good results by establishing a TF team which turns non-regular workers into regular workers after the government announced the non-regular worker to regular worker guidelines. CBNU President Lee Nam-ho said “This event is a milestone for job stability, social polarization and social integration. I’ll do my best to ensure that the workers have a happy life through the steady welfare.”
