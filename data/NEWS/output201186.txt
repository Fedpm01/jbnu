arch, CBNU started a labor-management relations manpower training course to train specialists in this field. This course has been continuously held since the Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL) selected CBNU as a training center for the Honam region in the New Advanced Labor Academy (NALA) in 2014. CBNU President Lee Nam-ho, Dean of the College of Commerce Park Sang-june, and 30 trainees attended the opening ceremony. By December, they will become experts through various classes. Professor Chae Jun-ho in the Division of Business Administration said, "This course will enable us to acquire effective skills in labor-management negotiations by systematizing professional theories and on-the-job training. We hope that it will enhance the professionalism of the students through mutual cooperation between the labor and management."
