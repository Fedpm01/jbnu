essor Hahn Yoon-bong in the School of Chemical Engineering and his team developed the Semi-transparent Perovskite Solar Cells which are stable and have excellent electrical properties. The Perovskite Solar Cells have a high efficiency of development. They are cheaper and more productive than before. However when they are exposed to the air, their lifespan decreases. Professor Hahn’s team did research to resolve this problem. They developed the NiO-Perovskite Nanocomposite in 2016. The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning supported their research. They published the results of their research about nanomaterial production based on Graphene and a solar cell’s application in May this year. The research improved the problems of solar cells in commercialization and showed the possibility of applying a Building Integrated Photovoltaic(BIPV) System.
