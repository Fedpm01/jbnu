 is enthusiastically pushing the Dragon Project which is a doctoral degree program of university professors in China. This project will help incumbent professors who do not have doctoral degrees in China universities to get a doctorate degree at CBNU. Many universities in China lack professors compared to the number of students and many professors who are currently planning to get doctoral degrees. So, this program is expected to have a good result. For the program, CBNU invited officials from seven universities, including Henan Normal University in China, and had serious discussions with explanations of the program. Yoon Myeong-Sook, the Vice President of the Office of International Cooperation, said, “By proceeding with this program, it will be possible to attract outstanding students and promotion of research cooperation between the two countries. Also, we will do our best as much as possible for many Chinese professors to get their doctoral degrees in CBNU.”
