essor Lee Joong-hee's team in the Graduate School Department of BIN Fusion Technology, developed an ultra-high efficiency solid supercapacitor manufacturing technology that can be used in future smart cars attracting attention from the world academic stage. Supercapacitors are energy storage devices widely used in various electronic equipments such as electric cars and mobile terminals, mainly used to give high output in a short time. The team's excellent research results drew global attention with their papers that were published in the world's leading journals ‘Advanced Energy Materials (IF = 21.88)’ and ‘Progress in Materials Science (IF = 31.14)’. Professor Lee said, "This new discovery is expected to be widely used as an electrode material for various next-generation energy storage and conversion devices, such as lithium ion secondary batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells.”
