 Business Incubator helped local businesses increase export opportunities by visiting Vietnam and Thailand. Business Incubator used the ‘Global Market Finder’ to pursue 18 MOU engagements. The Global Market Finder has been carrying this out for four years since 2015 to support small and medium-sized enterprises entering the overseas market. It made an effort to help Korean companies connect with buyers in various countries. It also taught that businesses should be corresponding to the buyers’ feature. The head of the Business Incubator, Kwon Tae-kyu said, “Based on this experience of actual investment, we will create exchange markets that can enter not only Vietnam and Thailand, but also various countries and strive to help local top companies to enter the global market.”
