 is the second highest-costing national university in educational expenses per student, following Seoul National University. ‘Educational expenses per student’ is the sum of operating expenses, scholarships, expenditures for books, experimentation, machines, and tools divided by the number of students. It is a representative index that shows how much a university invests in student education. When considering that CBNU students pay approximately four million Won a year for tuition, they receive benefits more than four times that expense. aThis is possible because CBNU has been chosen for government’s financial programs such as ACE, CK, LINC and CORE. President Lee Nam-ho said, “I think increasing investment in education for students, which is reason why a university exists is the basic responsibility of a university. CBNU will try to develop various programs for nurturing adventurous students and uphold our reputation through enrichment of education.”
