ovember 10, a harvest event was held to share the joy of harvesting among CBNU members and residents who had received a land of campus.

It is currently expanding to about 100 sections and renting them to residents, faculty members and students. CBNU provided free seedlings to recipients of the land.

At the event, participants of farming and university officials gathered to harvest crops and CBNU gave gifts to excellent participants and shared the prepared foods.
