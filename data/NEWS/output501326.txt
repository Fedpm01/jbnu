 Hanok to United StatesaaaaÂ aaaaaJBNU has achieved a successful export of Hanok to the U.S., following Algeria. In order to shape the export of Hanok, JBNU recently signed a business agreement with Alpha Solution Inc. of the United States. The main content of the agreement is the creation of a Hanok complex in Ellijay, Georgia. In addition, not only this Hanok is a house-keeping house that follows the traditional Korean style. However it is constructed in consideration of American life and submitted a plan to build Hanok against earthquakes. The Hanok complex aims to be completed in February 2022. It also said it will seek to enter the U.S. region and specifically push for exports to Las Vegas.
