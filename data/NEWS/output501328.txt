p Biodegradable Eco-friendly PlasticaaaaÂ aaaaaProfessor Han Ji-hoon, Min Ji-ho and Kim Sung-kon, majoring in chemical engineering at JBNU will receive 4.2 billion won for three years. They will carry out 'Kenaf-based eco-friendly bioplastic development and industrialization' industry. Petroleum plastics are convenient to use but take up to 500 years to decay. It is to develop biodegradable plastics using plants to replace these petroleum plastics. The project aims to find the green industry and promote the transition to the green economy. The technology developed is expected to commercialize products by transferring eco-friendly bioplastics to local companies, create new jobs, and revitalize the local economy.
