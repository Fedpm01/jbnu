t Lee Jae-wook, Wins the Best Paper Presentation Award at KCC 2021aaaaÂ aaaaaRecently, undergraduate student Lee Jae-wook in the Department of Software Engineering won the Best Paper Presentation Award at the KCC2021 (Korea Computer Congress 2021), which was hosted by the KIISE (Korean Institute Of Information Scientists And Engineers). He was recognized for his excellence in research by publishing a thesis titled "Multi-Output Neural Network Model that combines classification and regression in software defect prediction." This study applies a technique to construct a multi-output neural network model so that multiple information can be predicted with a single model. He added, "I would like to thank my fellow researchers, including Professor Ryu Duk-san and Professor Kim Sun-tae (All belong to the Department of Software Engineering), for helping me to be selected for the Best Paper Presentation Award. I will try to be a researcher suitable for the current era when the fourth industrial revolution."a aaaaaaa
