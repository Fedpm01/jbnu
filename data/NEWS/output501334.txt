lobe reviews how the food trashabin is managed.aaaaaaaaaÂ aaOne booth which looks like a phone booth can be found at the back of the 1st Student Hall. That is a food waste bin for the disposal of food waste in the 1st and 2nd Student Hall, which was recently installed by the 53rd Student Council. The food waste bin was installed in June and has been in operation to date. It only handles food waste generated on campus. JBNU has received criticism for its lack of food waste bins. On the other hand, a number of student hall users do not know the existence of a food garbage can. It would have been better to have promoted this to more students. Leaving much to be desired, we can get a glimpse of the efforts of the Student Council in that it is still operated and managed neatly.a aaaaaaa
