look at the improved attendance system in regards to vaccine related absencesaaaaaaaaaThe vaccine absence system excuses students of vaccinerelated absences. Attendance is automatically registered on the day of vaccination or until the next day, depending on the symptoms. Proof of vaccination must be submitted to the professor in order to be fairly recognized. Proof must include a doctor's note and a vaccination certification. However, there were a few people who complained of inconvenience when The JBNU Globe surveyed this system. The most common opinion was that the absence recognition period should be extended. Respondents desired an extension of excused absence days because symptoms vary by person, and some need more rest than others. Another complaint was directed at the hassle of submitting the excused absence documents separately for each professor. One respondent left a suggestion that it would be helpful to build a system that could submit the documents to each professor all at once.aaMeanwhile, professors are in a position to acknowledge excused absences in accordance with the school guidelines.aaÂ a aaaaaaa
