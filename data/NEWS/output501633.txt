s and seniors in terms of used textbooks.aaaaaaaaaLast September, some college student councils sold used books to students. It is quite expensive for students to buy all of the books every semester. Most students attend five to six classes in one semester, perhaps more. To come up with a remedy for this situation, more student councils adopted the project this year than last year.aa1. Stocking Up -> Recruit students who want to sell second-hand books through Kakao Talk open chat room.a2. Price Measuring -> Ask the expected price to the student sellers. Then, the student council judges the price.a3. Selling -> The student council makes charts filled with books and their prices.aaThe student council oversees selling and purchasing books to avoid unfair transactions. Since JBNU enforces online classes due to COVID-19, the student council is carrying out a parcel system for students in other regions (*collect on delivery). Moreover, the delivery system created an unexpected chance for juniors and seniors to meet. The student council is willing to expand the project to deal with other secondhand items.aaÂ a aaaaaaa
