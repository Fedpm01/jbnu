entor students roll up their sleeves to help international students.aaaaaaaaaAt JBNU, there are many programs to help international students easily adapt to campus. One of the Globe’s previous volumes (Vol.73) informed readers about the 'International Buddy' program to make friends in many countries. Unlike the International Buddy program, the Study-Assistant program will provide a bit of academic help for international students. The purpose of this program is for international students to receive help for any linguistic difficulties they face while studying. As a bonus, the program can help develop their Korean language skills. The Office of International Affairs, which hosts this program, selects Korean mentors through strict recruitment procedures. Student applicants must have a certain level of grade, and must be able to carefully write learning plans and diaries. Then, they match groups with one Korean mentor and one or two international students to work as a team; the program runs for one semester. The JBNU Globe met one of these teams and interviewed them about how they are doing on this program.aaaaaThe Korean mentor said he had studied abroad. He sympathized with international students adapting to the new environment alone and having difficulty taking classes in other languages, so he applied to be a mentor. Therefore, he said he prepared thoroughly and specifically for international students through his curriculum, despite having to proceed with the program online. Meanwhile, the international students said they are able to focus more on classes and develop academic skills with the meticulousness and consideration of their Korean mentors.aa a aaaaaaa
