BNU Central Library has started a book delivery service for disabled users. The library had already been providing book lending and returns services for disabled students. However, it had inconveniences such as receiving books through direct visits or self-funded courier service, so a better support plan was needed. Therefore, JBNU implemented a book delivery service that can be used by both students with disabilities and general disabled users. The books are delivered directly in universities and are delivered by free parcel service outside the school. Jeong Ahn-seong, director of the JBNU Central Library, said “the book delivery service is an effort to bridge the information access gap of disabled users and accompany those who are left out closer and warmer.” Meanwhile, JBNU Central Library has been making steady eff orts by carrying out facility improvement projects for disabled students as part of this year’s National University Development Project.aa aa a aaaaaaa
