aThe JBNU Hanok Architecture Technology Center was selected as an ‘excellent institution for training Hanok professionals’. It was conducted by the Ministry of Land and AURI (Architecture & Urban Research Institute) to certify educational institutions under the ‘Architectural Assets Promotion Act’. The JBNU Hanok Architecture Technology Center has fostered the Gochang campus to be Hanok-specialized. It has produced 1,500 graduates so far by operating long-term and short-term programs. Additionally, as a first in the architectural field, a ‘Hanok Introduction’ course has been established for the online open lecture platform, K-MOOC, and is providing education at domestic national universities and at universities in Jeollabuk-do. Recently, this course has contributed greatly to the spread of the Korean wave through Hanok architecture. This year, Korea’s first Hanok Architecture Department will be established at the Gochang Campus.a aaaaaaa
