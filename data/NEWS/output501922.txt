 Department of Environmental Engineering Students' team leaderaaaStudents from the Department of Environmental Engineering won the Excellence Award at the Korean Society of Environmental Engineers Capstone Design Competition. At this competition, teams of Environmental Engineering students showcased future environmental engineering technologies, designed and produced by each team. JBNU students submitted a public plastic self-cleaning container that utilizes water treatment and UV-C. This ingenious invention solved the problem of waste plastics being incinerated instead of recycled. As a result, the invention received considerable praise for increasing the net recycling rate. The JBNU team leader said, “When planning this design for the first taime, the goal was to find ways to solve environmental pollution and improve the environment by making the design easy for anyone to use in their daily life.” a aaaaaaa
