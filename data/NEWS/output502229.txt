Through the Campus Buddy Program, teams including one Korean mentor and two international mentees will spend time together and complete missions throughout the first semester. International students will be able to feel comfortable with their life in JBNU by walking around campus with their mentor, exploring Jeonju, making Korean traditional fans, and more. While spending time with mentees, the mentor can learn about different cultures and languages. “According to the survey answered by participants of last semester, many wished for more interactions with other teams. Therefore, the Office of International Affairs added ‘Let Me Introduce My Buddy’ as one of the missions, which is meeting other teams,” stated Park Hyun-woo from the Office of International Affairs. Coffee coupons are also given out to lighten the financial burden of participants, who need a place to meet. The next recruit will take place in August, and the number of participants may vary.aaaⓒLee Seung-yeonaaaLee Seung-yeon from the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences participated in the Campus Buddy Program because she wanted to meet people from abroad.
