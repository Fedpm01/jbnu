eorganizes the Belt Program to enable greater participationaaaaaaⓒPark Jeong-cheolaaaaSince March 1st, 2022, the Belt Program has been partially reorganized. First, the mandatory designations of the Yellow Belt among the Belt Program career belts were eased. Existing Korean history level 2 or higher, Korean level 2 or higher, or Chinese character level 2 or higher had to be completed, but all were abolished. Meanwhile, the Blue and Red Belt mandatory selection has been expanded. From the eight existing categories, Korean history level 1, Chinese character level 1, and Industrial Engineer Office Automation certificates were added, expanding the total to twelve categories. Furthermore, job competency deepening education was subdivided into points by completion time. Previously, thirty points were given regardless of the completion time, but after the reorganization, the points given differ depending on the completion time. As agreed, the General Student Council is progressing with the conference about the International Student Belt Program, but this is still in development. Currently, scholarships can be paid if international students meet a specific grade or higher of TOPIK, the Korean language proficiency test.aa aa| aChin Da-youna Editor, aPark Jeong-cheol aReportera aaaaaaa
