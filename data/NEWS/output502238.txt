ee Jeong-chan, a graduate student of the Graduate School of Bio-Nano Convergence Engineering at JBNU, won the Excellence Award for his presentation at the 2022 Spring Conference of the Korean Interventional Medical Devices Society. At this conference, he was recognized for his excellent research in the ‘development of multi-layer stent coating membrane manufacturing technology to prevent silicon/PCL peeling.’ aFurthermore, Lee proposed a new manufacturing method using a new high-speed electric radiator. aThe manufactured silicon-electric radiation fiber composite membrane has the benefit of imparting multi-function to a silicon film used for conventional stent coating, significantly increasing the physical properties of the electric radiation nano-biological membrane. This enhanced the possibility of solving the weaknesses of the ‘electric radiation nanofiber coating stents’, which have not been commercialized due to various issues. The possible solution is that they can be used as membranes for stent double coating technology.a aaaaaaa
