aThe team of professors Lee Jong-hee and Kim Nam-hoon from the Department of Nano Convergence Engineering have developed a non-precious metal catalyst that can mass-produce green hydrogen at an affordable price, drawing attention from academia around the world. The team has developed a new technology for producing catalysts in the shape of nano-multidimensional structures for green hydrogen. This can be manufactured in a relatively simple way using inexpensive metal materials such as iron and tin. The team predicted that commercialization will be possible in the near future as it shows excellent stability and durability compared to existing products. Green hydrogen is made by electrolyzing water during the production process, and thus is considered the most necessary future energy technology in the era of carbon neutrality, as hydrogen emits no carbon. This newly developed technology is a breakthrough in solving existing problems.a aaaaaaa
