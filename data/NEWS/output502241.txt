aThe JBNU Alumni Association is covering breakfast expenses for students. The association first began this program last fall under the name of ‘a warm breakfast with the Alumni Association’. Since March 7th, five convenience stores within the university have been supporting students with free kimbap, milk, probiotic drinks, and bread. For a week until March 16th, more than a thousand students had free breakfast and went to class. Student responses were very enthusiastic. A sophomore in the Department of Spanish and Latin American studies amentioned that she was able to start her day with a full stomach as she grabbed a quick bite at a convenience store on her way to school during this special event. aThe JBNU Alumni Association Chairman Chung Young-taek said, “we started this project by gathering the wishes of our alumni, who have the hearts of parents.” He added that he will promote this program among the alumni so that more students can benefit.a aaaaaaa
