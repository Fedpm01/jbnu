ang Se-rim, an assistant research professor from the Division of Mechanical Design Engineering, was selected for the 2022 Sejong Science Fellowship, a research project by the Ministry of Science and ICT. The research fellowship will grant professor Jang less than a hundred million won per year for five years. Through this support, she will carry out a project which involves manufacturing patterned bio-nanomembrane support, lymphatic fluid flow, and tissue regeneration effects in order to develop artificial lymphatic vessels with a diameter of less than 500Âµm under voluntary muscle contraction. This research will pave the way for developing a small-diameter artificial blood vessel with a diameter of 3mm or less, which is an unsolved challenge worldwide. This technology is anticipated to be widely used in the field of organizational engineering.a aaaaaaa
