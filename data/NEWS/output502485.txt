aProfessor Lee Jon-hwa's research team, in the College of Veterinary Medicine, has developed a new oral vaccine. World academia and British global medical media are paying attention to this. New oral vaccines make up for the shortcomings of the current Covid-19 vaccine. Traditional vaccines produce strong antibodies, but are vulnerable to breakthrough infections because they cannot effectively cause mucosal immunity. Professor Lee's team has developed a way to effectively defend against the Covid-19 virus by inducing strong mucosal immunity. Professor Lee Jon-hwa said, "The advantage of this oral vaccination method is its ability to be easily administered individually within a few days, and to minimize the emergence of mutant viruses by forming a collective defense in an instant. The development of this oral vaccine could be a big turning point in the current COVID-19 situation.‚Äùa aaaaaaa
