aJBNU ranked first among national flagship universities in the ‘evaluation of facility space utilization’ conducted at the National University in 2022. This evaluation is intended to induce efficient use of space. In this evaluation, JBNU received good reviews in terms of system-based preparation, the space utilization rate, space allocation status, and excess space management performance. JBNU minimized the space inefficiency between departments. Additionally, JBNU was able to achieve effectiveness through ‘Space Charging’. Space Charging is a system that distributes the space usable area by dividing the members of the school into individual professors, departments and colleges. JBNU revised various regulations and sought to establish space allocation procedures by benchmarking the best practices. The JBNU President, Kim Dong-won, said "I am happy that the efforts to minimize inefficient space has led to increased satisfaction with space allocation.” He added, “We will make efforts to provide a better educational and research environment.”a aaaaaaa
