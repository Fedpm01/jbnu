aProfessor Jeong Chang-kyu's team in the Major of Electronic Materials Engineering, have developed a Skin-Adherent Piezoelectric Patch. The patch is highly adhesive, made by grafting a piezoelectric composite material to the structure of an octopus sucker. Professor Chang-kyu’s team has collaborated with professor Pang Chang-hyun’s team of the School of Chemical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University. The piezoelectric composite film had the limitation of easily falling off the body and not sticking to wet areas. To overcome this limitation, the two teams developed a method for developing an octopus sucker structure. Professor Jeong said that this research made it possible to make an efficient piezoelectric healthcare sensor. In addition, professor Pang revealed the significance of this research as the signal for fusion research to begin in the piezoelectric element field. a aaaaaaa
