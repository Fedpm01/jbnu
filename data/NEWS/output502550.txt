t exchange programs have resumed after two years.aaaaThe student exchange programs, which had been suspended due to COVID-19, have continued. Due to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, students can go abroad to study instead of taking online ZOOM classes. Yet some issues arose during the dispatch process. The JBNU Globe listened to Minjae's story about going to England for the student exchange program. aa“The school official told me to buy a flight ticket after the orientation, but the orientation was too close to the program's start.  The plane ticket price was going up daily, so I asked them to advance the date, and luckily I was able to proceed with the orientation a week early.” Additionally, she had hoped to solve problems as soon as they arose, but that was not always the case. "There was a problem with the airport pickup, but it wasn't immediately resolved at the time. Also, I was informed that my dormitory had suddenly changed before I left the country, but I didn't hear the exact reason for this."aaDespite these issues, she mentioned being happy studying abroad. "It was nice to be able to receive training programs at a relatively safe and verified institution at a language training program through JBNU. I was also excited about being able to get close to students from other countries while taking classes there."aaaaaAs students at JBNU, everyone has the opportunity to study foreign languages abroad!
