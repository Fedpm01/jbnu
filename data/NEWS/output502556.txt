aThe southeast language camp, which will be joined by JBNU and BUFS(Busan University of Foreign Studies), held the opening ceremony on July 18th and subsequently began two weeks of language courses. The camp, which is held every year between JBNU and BUFS, has been well-received because it provides free opportunities to study Vietnamese, Malay, Thai, and Filipino. This year, those language courses will be offered in addition to Arabic and Italian. Sixty-four students from sixteen universities nationwide participated in the camp. JBNU provides the Residence Halls and other facilities for participants from outside of Jeonju. Jeon Je-Seong, the director of the JBNU Institute for Southeast Asian Studies, said, “I’m glad that the camp, which has been held for the past three years, can be held with a lot of support this summer.” He also recommended taking a beginner course at JBNU in the summer followed up with an intermediate course at BUFS in the winter.a aaaaaaa
