aJBNU will build an urban high-tech industrial complex on campus. It will be a start-up hub that combines major companies, start-ups, R&D (Research & Development) centers, and support facilities. More than 180 companies, including Naver, KT, Harim, and IMI will participate in the project. JBNU will develop the sites of the old main gate and gymnasium in three phases by 2030. The first phase of this project is to develop a base for future industrial development and local development. The second phase is to develop a base for upgrading R&D to enter global markets. The third phase is to foster a town with a work-life balance for employees. This project has high expectations for an efficient relationship with local governments. JBNU President Kim Dong-won said, “I think it will affect local development and job creation for youth.”a aaaaaaa
