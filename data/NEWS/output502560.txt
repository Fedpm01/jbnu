aJBNU held an opening ceremony for summer rural volunteer work. aThis has resumed for the first time in three years since COVID-19, and 83 students participated, including the JBNU Student Association. Before starting the volunteer work for rural communities, the Bureau of Student Affairs provided safety accident prevention education for the students. The Bureau also guided and inspected the volunteer work, staying alongside them at the volunteer work area. From July 5th to 8th, students did volunteer work at four villages in Imsil-gun. They helped with farming and other activities, such as cleaning up the villages and harvesting crops. JBNU President Kim Dong-won said, “through this volunteer work, if students can understand the reality of rural communities and realize the worth of sweating over valuable work, that will help rural communities very much.”a aaaaaaa
