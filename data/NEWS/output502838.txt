aProfessor Cho Jae-young from the Department of Bioenvironmental Chemistry donated thirty million won for the development fund. He hoped for improvement in JBNU’s competitiveness. Cho has continued to donate since his appointment as a professor in 2008. So far, he has donated one hundred million won. Cho’s family are all alumni of JBNU, so they gathered their hearts to fund their alma mater. This is meaningful because it is not only Cho’s strong will but also his wife and son’s too. On September 14th, President Kim Dongwon held a donation ceremony for the development fund and invited Cho and Cho’s wife to honor them with a plaque of appreciation. Cho said, “I hope JBNU will develop further and our students will be able to study in a good environment.”a aaaaaaa
