aGraduate students from the College of Nursing at JBNU have a beautiful culture in which seniors donate to their juniors. Seniors are raising funds to improve the educational environment for their juniors. This year, masters and Ph.D. students are actively donating to their undergraduate and graduate peers and creating a beautiful tradition. They have raised thirty-one million won and have donated it to the JBNU Development Foundation for the College of Nursing fund. Since these seniors are busy studying and working, just like their juniors are, they became united in their affection for them. In the seven years since 2016, the amount they have donated has reached three hundred million won. On November 15th, JBNU invited its masters and Ph.D. student representatives from the College of Nursing to development funds donation ceremony and gave each of them an appreciation plaque.a aaaaaaa
