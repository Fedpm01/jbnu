aProfessor Kim Jin-soo’s team, from the Department of Information Materials Engineering, has developed an ‘image array (IA) composed of touch-free sensors (TFSs)’. The results of this study were published in a『aMaterials Horizons(IF 15.717)a』a, a representative journal of athe Royal Society of Chemistry. In addition, the original technology was secured by a patent application. Professor Kim said, “The biggest outcome of this study is that we have produced a high-quality semiconductor nano-structure, secured original technologies, and suggested the possibility of acommercializationa.” He added that he thinks his students had a valuable experience growing into researchers as they participated in this study. Through follow-up research, the team plans to develop key technologies to implement in the component and advanced science technology industries.a aaaaaaa
