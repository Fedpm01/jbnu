neral Student Council held a JBNU Topper Contest to select a topper design to represent JBNUaaaaaaⓒ Chae Won-jinaaaaA JBNU Topper Contest was held for a week beginning on December 8th. The JBNU Globe interviewed Kim Tae-woong, the director of the planning team for The General Student Council. First, Kim introduced the purpose of the contest. He said, “the purpose of this contest is to create an item that symbolizes JBNU.” The General Student Council found this need while investigating the cases of other universities. He then explained the process of the vote after the contest. He emphasized, “transparency is the top priority during the vote.” Students voted through a Google Form from December 16th to 19th. The design with the most votes was to be produced into the JBNU topper. At last, ‘No.10 Design’ was selected as the winner among eleven designs. The student who designed No.10 was awarded two hundred thousand won and a topper. aaAfter the vote, the group purchase was carried out according to the results of the survey. The new toppers were delivered between the third and fourth weeks of January. The next group purchase will be processed this November if demand is sufficient. At the end of the interview, Kim mentioned what he thought about the contest. He said, “the active voting waas a positive thing, but the school's support wasn’t enough. If the school had supported a larger budget and promoted thea atoppers more extensively, I think more students woulda ahave been interested in it.”aa aa aa| aHa Yae-one aEditora, Jo Soo-jin, Chae Won-jina aReportersa aaaaaaa
