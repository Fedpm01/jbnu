aJeong Ha-rok, a first-year master’s student at JBNU graduate school in the Department of Physics, wrote a paper as the first author of ‘Carbon. IF 11.3’, which has been published in the worldwide journal in the field of carbon materials research. Doctor Kim Jungpil at the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology Division in Jeollabuk-do and professor An Sangmin in the Department of Physics assisted him. In his research, he found a way to distinguish the edge structures of carbon nanobelts and carbon nanohoops. In addition, he proved that it is possible to distinguish edge structures and the diameter difference of carbon nanomaterials by analyzing the spectrum. The research results are expected to contribute to the precise synthesis and analysis of carbon nanomaterials. “I realized that this research can contribute to society. I am not doing this for others, but for me to accumulate my experiences,” Jeong stated.a aaaaaaa
