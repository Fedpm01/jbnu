aSince last year, JBNU has been conducting an ‘NCD management project’ in Cambodia with the KAHP (Korea Association of Health Promotion). This project began when JBNU and KAHP were selected as Public Private Partnerships of Korea International Cooperation Agency. The mobile health app was developed through a joint project. The app aims to reduce NCDs' (noncommunicable diseases) prevalence by improving universal access to health information such as NCD tracking management and self-health education. In particular, three hundred high-risk groups for NCDs were selected through basic health checkups. They are regularly visited by health extension workers to strive for systematic and sustainable self-health care. Professor Yang Young-ran from the Department of Nursing, and the project manager in Korea, said, “we will try to ensure sustainable preventive management of NCDs together with KAHP.”a aaaaaaa
