aPebble Square, wherea aBae Hag-youla,a a professor from the JBNU Department aof Electronica Engineering, is the founder, has started to develop and sell neuromorphic semiconductor chips that utilize PIM (Processing-In-Memory) technology. Pebble Square signed an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) awith JBNU and the related research team in KAIST in July 2022 to conduct joint research on intelligent semiconductorsa. The newly developed semiconductor chip MINT is the world's first PIM-based high-performance, ultra-low power 'Edge AI Chip'. Existing computer systems are not efficient in their power consumption limits. MINT's artificial neural network has four million synapses built-in to support thirty GOPS of computing power and high energy efficiency, which can seamlessly process atypical characters, voices, and images that are difficult for existing computers to intuitively recognize.a aaaaaaa
