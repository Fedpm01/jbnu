en professors of the College of Humanities give free humanities lectures at the Jeonju Municipal Libraries.aaaaaaⓒ Yang Seo-jungaaaa aaFree humanities lectures are being held for twenty weeks, which started from March 11th, for Jeonju citizens. The lectures are held from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. at nine Jeonju Municipal Libraries, and nineteen professors from the College of Humanities are taking turns giving lectures. aaThe JBNU Globe interviewed two people who listened to Professor Lee Hyeong-woo’s (Department of Archaeology and cultural anthropology) lecture on March 18th. The topic of the lecture was “The Way of Man: People and People's Culture in Archaeology”. Oh Shi-won, a student of Kongju National University, said, “At first, I listened to it to fill up the volunteer hours but after I heard it, it was fun and informative because the lecturer explained the literature while teaching history. There are various lecture topics, so I have a plan to listen to all of them.” Another auditor Kim Soo-ye said, “I got the information about the lectures from a pamphlet at the library. The lecture was informative, because I am personally interested in archaeology. It was a shame that the lecture ended in the midst of explaining the contents of the Paleolithic art section due to time.” Then she added, “if there are other topics that I am interested in, I will listen to them also.” aaThere are twenty different and interesting topics, so why don't you go to the library and listen to them? The application period begins two weeks before each lecture. You can register for the lecture through the Jeonju Municipal Library website or make a call to the library.aaaaaFor more information about the program, visit the library website.
