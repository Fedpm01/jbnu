aKoo Ja-hyeon, a graduate student of a research team led by professor Jeong Kwang-un from the Department of Nano Convergence Engineering at JBNU, developed smart photonic crystal fluorescent material through a simple process using light. The reflection wavelength and circular polarized fluorescence characteristics of the material are controlled by ultraviolet exposure time. In addition, Photopolymerization is also possible, so it is expected to be applied to advanced optical filters and high-dimensional security films. The results of this research appeared on the cover of ≪Advanced Optical Materials≫, which is a prominent international journal in the fields of optical and material sciences, on March 17th. Koo said, “we hope this study will be widely used in optical and material fields as it can be applied to advanced optical filters and composite safety films.”a aaaaaaa
