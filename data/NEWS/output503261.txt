aThe JBNU Natural History Museum opened on March 2nd, creating a metaverse platform that moved some of its exhibition rooms online according to the changing times. It consists of seven maps, including the exterior of the building, lobby, lecture room, and a quiz room. In particular, attention is being paid to the ecological education programs through an online metaverse space for elementary and middle school students. This program allows students to learn about biodiversity in the classroom, look at wildlife displayed in the online exhibition room, and make use of their knowledge of taxonomy. Whang Sung-soo, director of the JBNU Natural History Museum, said, "This opening will enable internal viewing and educational programs of the museum, which is closed due to seismic reinforcement work until June fifth of this year.” He added, “It will allow children to experience fun ecological education using games.”a aaaaaaa
